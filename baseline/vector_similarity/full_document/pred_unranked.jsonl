18th century. many varieties have been bred for horticulture, with low - growing, and large, and long - flowering forms. leaves of'' gardenia jasminoides'''' gardenia jasminoides'' is a shrub that ranges from 30 cm to 3 m ( 1 \u2013 10 ft ) high in the wild, with cylindrical to flat branches that at first are covered with caducous hairs that fall early, leaving the branch smooth. the leaves are in opposite pairs or rarely in groups of three along the branches. they are either subsessile ( almost without a petiole ) or on short petioles. the leaves themselves are long by wide and can be oblong - lanceolate, obovate - oblong, obovate, oblanceolate, or elliptic in shape. their upper surface is smooth and shiny, or slightly hairy along the primary veins, while the undersurface is sparsely hairy to smooth. each leaf has 8 to 15 pairs of secondary veins. the flowers are solitary and terminal, arising from the ends of the stems. the white flowers have a matte texture, in contrast to the glossy leaves. they gradually take on a creamy yellow color and a waxy surface. they can be quite large, up to in diameter, loosely funnel -

mayor, decide to divide the wood so that rabbit could be mayor on one side, and tigger can be mayor on the other. they have beaver draw a white line through the hundred acre wood. the problem is that the white line separates the people on each side from their friends. everyone, except darby and buster, is to stay on their side which results to problems and chaos. tigger and pooh can no longer sleuth, roo and lumpy can't visit each other, tigger and rabbit no longer be friends, and goods, supplies and materials can't be traded ( which means no thistles for eeyore and no cookies made by kanga ). rabbit sees the sadness and decides to cheer everyone up by having a picnic on his side and tigger does the same. but the picnics are no fun due to everyone being separated until darby hatches a plan to reunite the hundred acre wood and have everything go back to normal, and it worked. rabbit and tigger, having seen the error of their ways, both step down from being mayor and order beaver to remove the white line, restoring peace to the hundred acre wood. * chloe grace moretz as darby * dee bradley baker as buster and woodpecker * jim cummings as winnie -

novels often include negative american characters, motivated by power or greed. in addition,'' the hunt for red october'' is considered a coming - of - age story regarding the main character jack ryan. however, instead of running away from responsibilities, a theme common in contemporary american literature, clancy subverts the convention by having ryan rushing toward the burdens of the adult world. moreover, the book introduced jack ryan as a new archetype of the american hero \u2014 an everyman who uses his prior knowledge instead of physical power in solving a particular crisis. from a young age, clancy was an avid reader of naval history and sea exploration. however, he was later rejected from serving in the military because of his poor eyesight. since graduating from high school and eventually earning an english major, he always wanted to write a novel. he eventually worked as an insurance agent for a small business owned by his then - wife's family. in his spare time, clancy started working on'' the hunt for red october'' on november 11, 1982, and finished it four months later on february 23, 1983. contrary to popular belief that clancy had access to top - secret intelligence in researching for the novel, he consulted technical manuals, discussions with former submariners and books like norman polmar \u2019 s'' guide to the soviet navy'' and'' combat fleets of the world'' in order to maintain accuracy in describing soviet submarines. he then submitted the first draft of the novel to the naval institute press, where he previously wrote an article on the mx

wing intellectuals excepted, for letting hitler into power in 1933, for surrendering france in 1940 and for collaborating actively or passively. this stance was confirmed by renoir shortly after the film came out when, in a speech, he asserted that his recent films \" breathed this breath of anti -

papuan songbird radiation. there is some molecular support for suggesting that their closest relatives are the large lyrebirds. as their name implies, treecreepers forage for insects and other small creatures living on and under the bark of trees, mostly eucalypts, though several species also hunt on the ground, through leaf - litter, and on fallen timber. unlike the holarctic treecreepers they do not use their tail for support when climbing tree trunks, only their feet. australasian treecreepers nest in holes in trees. the species in the family hold breeding territories, although the extent to which they are defended and last varies. some species, such as the red - browed treecreeper and the brown treecreeper are cooperative breeders, others, like the white - throated treecreeper are not. the cooperative breeders form groups or a single breeding pair as well as up to three helpers, which are usually the young males of previous pairings. helpers assist with the construction of the nest, feeding of the incubating female and feeding and defending the young. the australasian treecreepers are small oscine songbirds, measuring in length and weighing. they have relatively long tails, short legs with strong feet, stout bodies and longish and slightly down - curved bills. the plumage of this family is dull, trending towards brown, reddish - brown or greyish brown above and paler below. there is usually some sexual dimorphism in plumage, with females having some reddish colour in the head or breast that is absent in the males. other differences between the sexes are common, and can arise very early in the life of these birds, being present even in late -

third of all parrot species are threatened by extinction, with higher aggregate extinction risk ( iucn red list index ) than any other comparable bird group. parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with several species inhabiting temperate regions in the southern hemisphere, as well. the greatest diversity of parrots is in south america and australasia. characteristic features of parrots include a strong, curved bill, an upright stance, strong legs, and clawed zygodactyl feet. many parrots are vividly coloured, and some are multi - coloured. most parrots exhibit little or no sexual dimorphism in the visual spectrum. they form the most variably sized bird order in terms of length. the most important components of most parrots'diets are seeds, nuts, fruit, buds, and other plant material. a few species sometimes eat animals and carrion, while the lories and lorikeets are specialised for feeding on floral nectar and soft fruits. almost all parrots nest in tree hollows ( or nest boxes in captivity ), and lay white eggs from which hatch altricial ( helpless ) young. parrots, along with ravens, crows, jays, and magpies, are among the most intelligent birds, and the ability of some species to imitate human speech enhances their popularity as pets. trapping wild parrots for the pet trade, as well as hunting, habitat loss, and competition from invasive species, has diminished wild populations, with parrots being subjected to more exploitation than any other group of birds. as of 2021, about 50 million parrots ( half of all parrots ) live in captivity, with the vast majority of these living as pets in people's homes. measures taken to conserve the habitats of some high -

chapters on 574 pages. the chapters about'' plastids and pigments'' as well as'' slime molds'' were removed and two additional chapters were included ('' how materials enter and leave the cell'' and''

field of botanical teaching. with every new edition, improvements were praised. integrating physiological and functional aspects with the structural and morphological aspects aided in students'understanding of botany. each edition contained new illustrations that were highly accurate in detail and proportion and showed depth and perspective. this was a considerable improvement over botanical drawings in other elementary botany textbooks. some criticised the book for its conservative viewpoint in teaching comparative morphology, arguing that it was \" written for the convenience

book, such as the absence of historical material about science and the lack of sufficient information about life cycles and reproductive features of the described species. as of 2022, the field of

palestinian conflict, while ze'evi is known for his previous work on early modern ottoman history. the central argument of the book is that the hamidian massacres, the armenian genocide, assyrian genocide, and greek genocide should be understood as a single event, which targeted all the christian minorities in the ottoman empire. the authors note that it is not disputed by scholars that while five million christians lived in the lands that became turkey in 1894 ( 20 percent of the population ), only tens of thousands remained in 1924, and at least two million were murdered by muslims. the authors identify a pattern that repeats, with minor variations, across the time period under study. the first targets of attack are men of military age and those with influence, then women and children are handled later. following previous scholarship, the authors identify islam and religious fundamentalism as the primary causes of the genocide, which had as its aim the foundation of a pure, muslim state. victims were asked to convert to islam, which sometimes saved the lives of targeted women and children. the book is more than 640 pages long. herve georgelin describes the book \" an ambitious and comprehensive work on the extinction of christian life on the former central ottoman lands \" and \" a clever and learned synthesis \". according to georgelin, the fact that both authors do not belong to any of the affected communities means that they can take a birds'- eye view as opposed to \" duplicating social ethno -

day adventist church's operations in western rwanda, by seven adventist pastors who had taken refuge with other tutsis in an adventist hospital in the locality of mugonero in kibuye prefecture. gourevitch accused ntakirutimana of aiding the killings that happened in the complex the next day. ntakirutimana was eventually convicted by the international criminal tribunal for rwanda. the book not only explains the genocide's peak in 1994, but the history of rwanda leading up to the major events. this book won numerous awards, including the 1998 national book critics circle award, the'' los angeles times'' book prize, the 1999 guardian first book award and the george k. polk award for foreign reporting. africanist rene lemarchand criticizes the book : what is missing from gourevitch's account is the how and why of the killings. it is one thing to describe the horror, another to explain the motivations that occasioned the carnage.... the absence of attention to the history of the country creates a portrait of a genocide that is insensitive to the complexity of the circumstances. in essence, gourevitch's story reduces the butchery to the tale of bad guys and good guys, innocent victims and avatars of hate. his frame of reference is the holocaust. the book was featured as one of the first brotherhood 2. 0 book club books. in 2019, it was ranked by'' slate'' as one of the 50 best nonfiction books of the past 25 years. * leon mugesera"}, {"title": "Machete Season", "chunk": "for 30 years now compounded with radio propaganda and interahamwe activism prepared the hutu to accept the idea of extermination. the killers of a genocide do not feel responsible. they speak without fatigue, without nervousness, without showing much emotion. when they approach the issue of forgiveness, they see it as a due and do not imagine that it cannot be granted. writing in the'' peace and conflict monitor'', sam wolf points out how this book is perhaps the only one on the literature on genocide who asks \u201c those responsible to explain it for us \u201d ; the book, he adds, will be of particular interest to \u201c those with an interest in the psychology of violence a grand scale \u201d. in the'' washington post'', alison des forges considered the book \u201c limited in scope and marred by numerous errors \u201d but, added, \u201c its grassroots view of the genocide enriches and completes other, more formal, accounts. \u201d'' publishers weekly'' wrote that \" steering clear of politics, this important book succeeds in offering the reader some grasp of how such unspeakable acts unfolded. \" lee ann fujii of georgetown university described the book as \" a valuable window \u2014 albeit one that has been keenly shaped by the author \u2014 on the transformation of one group of men, from one region of the country, from ordinary peasants into genocidaires. \" she stated that the book had some \" awkwardly translated passages from the original french \". fujii stated that while \" having the killers speak directly to the reader is a powerful tactic \", the book does not specify what hatzfield asked the genocide participants, and therefore it is not known whether ideas in their responses originated from the interviewer or the interviewees ; according to fujii, \" this sense of streaming monologue, in turn, helps to render these men as cold -

sponsored violence against armenians in the ottoman empire and turkey from the eighteenth to the twenty - first century, focusing especially on the armenian genocide and its persistent denial in turkey. among the arguments made in the book is that the armenian genocide was an act of foundational violence that enabled the creation of the republic of turkey and its continuing denial is an ideological foundation of the turkish nation - state. the book was praised by reviewers for its extensive research and methodological innovation, although some noted that it was dense and not easy to read for those not familiar with the topic. gocek spent 12 years researching and writing the book, which was published by oxford university press in 2015. gocek analyzes 356 memoirs, written by 307 authors, mostly turks, for what they have to say about collective anti - armenian violence. she did not select these works but instead \" systematically read all books printed in turkey in turkish after the latin script reform of 1928 that contained people \u2019 s recollections of what went on around them from the year 1789 to 2009 \". this systematic approach, gocek argues, helps the researcher investigate memoirs as sources without falling prey to the biases inherent to such sources. she mainly investigates the ways in which ottoman and turkish elites understood, rationalized, justified, and denied \" their own culture of anti - armenian violence through two centuries \". she argues that the armenian genocide was an act of foundational violence that enabled the creation of the turkish nation - state and that its denial is an ideological foundation of that state. she analyzes denial as a process, where each episode of violence is built on previous denials and leads to additional denials. according to gocek, denial is the factor that perpetuates collective violence across centuries. the book contains an introduction, conclusion, and four chapters : \" imperial denial of origins of violence, 1789 \u2013 1907 \", \" young turk denial of the act of violence, 1908 \u2013 1918 \", \" early republican denial of actors of violence, 1919 \u2013 1973 \", and \" late republican denial of responsibility for violence, 1974 \u2013 2009 \". gocek expresses hope that her documentation of violence in ottoman and turkish sources \" will hopefully enable the contemporary turks to recognise what happened in their past as narrated by their own ancestors \"."}, {"title": "It Can't Happen Here", "chunk": "##sberg wrote in'' slate'' that one \" can \u2019 t read lewis'novel today without flashes of trumpian recognition. \" following the results of the 2016 united states presidential election, sales of'' it can't happen here'' surged significantly, and it appeared on amazon. com's list of bestselling books. penguin modern classics released a new edition of the novel on january 20, 2017, the same day as the inauguration of donald trump. ; books * dystopian novel set in a near -

armenian hate discourse \". akcam wrote a book,'' killing orders'', in order to debunk the claims of orel and yuca and prove that the telegrams were authentic. in 2017, akcam was able to access one of the original telegrams, archived in jerusalem, which inquired about armenian liquidation and elimination. according to andonian, the documents were collected by an ottoman official called naim bey, who was working in the refugees office in aleppo, and handed by him to andonian. each note bears the signature of mehmed talaat pasha, the minister of interior and later grand vizier of the ottoman empire. the contents of these telegrams'' \" clearly states his intention to exterminate all armenians, outlines the extermination plan, offers a guarantee of immunity for officials, calls for tighter censorship and draws special attention to the children in armenian orphanages. \"'' the telegrams remain in coded form and are written in ottoman turkish. the overall picture emerging from these narrations points to a network of the extermination for most of the deportees. it overwhelmingly confirms the fact of what british historian arnold j. toynbee ( lse, university of london ) called \" this gigantic crime that devastated the near east \". bahaeddin sakir telegram of 4 july 1915 : \" have armenians who were deported from there been eliminated? have those harmful elements who were distanced from there through deportation been"}, {"title": "Denial of Violence", "chunk": "\" young turk denial of the act of violence, 1908 \u2013 1918 \", \" early republican denial of actors of violence, 1919 \u2013 1973 \", and \" late republican denial of responsibility for violence, 1974 \u2013 2009 \". gocek expresses hope that her documentation of violence in ottoman and turkish sources \" will hopefully enable the contemporary turks to recognise what happened in their past as narrated by their own ancestors \". jo laycock states that \" this highly detailed account is by no means an easy introduction \" ; gocek presumes knowledge of the armenian genocide itself as well as willingness to engage with a variety of approaches to the subject matter. however, for specialists it \" is a welcome addition to the scholarship \" and \" conceptually and methodologically sophisticated \". sossie kasbarian and kerem oktem called the book \" the finest scholarship \" and \" a ground -

book by american author and science writer charles c. mann about the pre - columbian americas. it was the 2006 winner of the national academies communication award for best creative work that helps the public understanding of topics in science, engineering or medicine. the book presents recent research findings in different fields that suggest human populations in the western hemisphere \u2014 that is, the indigenous peoples of the americas \u2014 were more numerous, had arrived earlier, were more sophisticated culturally, and controlled and shaped the natural landscape to a greater extent than scholars had previously thought. the author notes that, according to these findings, two of the first six independent centers of civilization arose in the americas : the first, norte chico or'' caral - supe'', in present - day northern peru ; and that of formative - era mesoamerica in what is now southern mexico. mann develops his arguments from a variety of recent re - assessments of longstanding views about the pre - columbian world, based on new findings in demography, climatology, epidemiology, economics, botany, genetics, image analysis, palynology, molecular biology, biochemistry, and soil science. although there is no consensus, and mann acknowledges controversies, he asserts that the general trend among scientists currently is to acknowledge : # # : ( a ) population levels in the native americans were probably higher than traditionally believed among scientists and closer to the number estimated by \" high counters. \" # : ( b ) humans probably arrived in the americas earlier than thought, over the course of multiple waves of migration to the new world ( not solely by the bering land bridge over a relatively short period of time ). # the level of cultural advancement and the settlement range of humans was higher and broader than previously imagined. # the new world was not a wilderness at the time of european contact, but an environment which the indigenous peoples had altered for thousands of years for their benefit, mostly with fire. these three main foci ( origins / population, culture, and environment ) form the basis for three parts

builders, scientists, artists, and students are able to make this new framework real for themselves, for their own lives, and for their own work. alexander gives us a feast for the eyes, the mind, and the heart. the foundations of modern scientific thought, four centuries old, are firmly rooted in a conception that the universe is a machinelike entity, a play of baubles, machines, trinkets. to this day, our real daily experience of ourselves has no clear place in science. it is little wonder that a machinelike world - view has supported the deadly architecture of the last century. this mechanistic thinking and the consequent investment - oriented tracts of houses, condominiums and offices have dehumanized our cities and our lives. how are spirit, soul, emotion, feeling to be introduced into a building, or a street, or a development project, in modern times? in this process, he approached religious questions from a scientific and philosophical rather than mystical direction, focusing in human feelings, well - being and nature interaction rather than metaphysics. the luminous ground, the fourth book of'' the nature of order'', contains what is, perhaps, the deepest revelation in the four - volume work. alexander addresses the cosmological implications of the theory he has presented. the book begins with a critique of current cosmological thinking, and its separation from personal feeling and value. the outline of a theory in which matter itself is more spirit - like, more personal in character, is sketched. here is a geometrical view of space and matter seamlessly connected to our own private, personal, experience as sentient and knowing creatures. this is not merely an emotional appendix to the scientific theory of the other books. it is at the core of the entire work, and is rooted in the fact that our two sides - our analytical thinking selves, and our vulnerable emotional personalities as human beings - are coterminous, and must be harnessed at one and the same time, if we are ever to really make sense of what is around us, and be able to create a living world. alexander breaks away completely from the one - sided mechanical

notion of a pre - modern constitution as well, though its less codified conventions would not amount to guarantees. each of his constitutions addresses four, so to speak, ontological realms : the subject, the object, language and being. the realm of the subject is also that of society, communities, culture and the state ; the realm of the object is that of things, technologies, facts and nature ; the realm of language includes practices of discourse, mediation, translation, delegation and representation ; and, finally, the realm of being includes god and the gods, the immortals, the totemized ancestors \u2013 it includes questions of existence. for latour every epoch \u2019 s constitution must have conventions and guarantees in these four ontological realms. the four guarantees of the modern constitution for latour are : ( a ) that nature ( i. e. things, objects ) is \u201c transcendent \u201d, or universal in time and space ; there to be discovered ; ( b ) that society (

research to demonstrate social intuitionism, how people's beliefs come primarily from their intuitions, and rational thought often comes after to justify initial beliefs. he cites david hume and e. o. wilson as thinkers who gave reason a relatively low estimation, as opposed to more popular thinkers who give reason a central place in moral cognition, such as lawrence kohlberg and his stages of moral reasoning. in the second portion of the book, he presents moral foundations theory, and applies it to the political beliefs of liberals, conservatives, and libertarians in the us. haidt argues that people are too quick to denigrate other points of view without giving those views full consideration, and attempts to reach common ground between liberals and conservatives. he makes the case in the book for morality having multiple foundations ( more than just harm and fairness ), and said in an interview that morality \" is at least six things, and probably a lot more than that \" and \" religion and politics are \u2026 expressions of our tribal, groupish, righteous nature. \" haidt himself acknowledges that while he has been a liberal all his life, he is now more open to other points

southwest. a message of environmental conservation and a philosophy of cultural and sociopolitical regionalism loosely links the stories together. ; \" the land of little rain \" the opening essay describes the \" country of lost borders, \" an area of land between death valley and the high sierras. the image created of the land at the beginning of the story is one of almost unbearable heat and dryness, punctuated by violent storms. despite the description of how inhospitable the landscape is, at the end austin proposes that the costs the land imposes upon a man are worth it because it provides man with peace of mind and body that cannot be achieved any other way. ; \" water trails of the ceriso \" the section's title refers to the trails made by wild animals moving towards sources of water across the landscape of an area known as the ceriso. the ceriso is not defined in the text, but in \" the last antelope, \" austin says that it \" rises steeply from the tilted mesa overlooked by black mountain, darkly red as the red cattle that graze among the honey colored hills, \" and that it is \" not properly mesa nor valley, but a long healed crater miles wide, rimmed about with the jagged edge"}, {"title": "The Land of Little Rain", "chunk": "homesick when in homes built by man, as man cannot replicate nature's walls and furnishings. ; \" the streets of the

critiques people who dwell in man - made houses. the comfort provided by such houses, austin argues, results in people not being able to truly understand the beauty and divinity of the mountains. ; \" water borders \" the essay revolves around the streams and lakes that can be found in the mountains, generally formed from the melting snow higher in the mountains. the particular mountain in the story is oppapago, a mountain within the sierras in a forest reserve. austin contrasts the mountain landscape to a meadow outside a forest reserve, which lacks color and beauty because it is damaged by the grazing of sheep. ; \" other water borders \" \" other water borders \" is centered more on the plants affected by the water from the mountains, both wild and cultivated. the story begins with a depiction of a squabble between several locals over an irrigation ditch filled by water from the mountains. this is followed by a series of descriptions of the variety of plants that the irrigation ditch allows to thrive. found within these depictions of plant life is austin's lament of the complexities of civilization. austin implies that with the advent of cities and manufactured objects people have lost an innate ability to know what natural remedies may be beneficial or detrimental to one's health. ; \" nurslings of the sky \" the \" nurslings of the sky \" are storms, formed in the

nature, but rather the people whose poorly placed town was destroyed. the story continues with descriptions of storms and their effects upon the wildlife of the area, pausing to explain how the land teaches people things. the story uses the example of a group of native americans who learn the use of smoke signals by observing the dust pillars formed by desert winds at the edges of mesas. the end of the story expresses austin's discontent at how people have dealt with the weather by determining the best seasons to plant crops rather than by musing about the \" eternal meanings of the skies \".

brown, except the grayish face. the summer coat is slate - gray. the large, white rump patch, which includes the short tail, has no dark rim as it is seen in the sichuan deer, for example. those from the eastern part of the range have a dark dorsal line and represent probably the'' c. c. affinis'' type, which is now usually included in the'' shou''. tibetan red deer, along with sichuan deer and kansu red deer, forms the southern group of wapiti. it lives in northern bhutan and southern tibet, where it is recorded from the chumbi valley close to sikkim and from lake manasarovar. it was believed to be completely extinct until a small population was rediscovered in 1988 in bhutan and southeastern tibet. the original range probably covered many smaller valleys of the brahmaputra river to the north of the himalaya ( yarlung tsangpo river ). a survey in 1995 brought the exciting finding, that a population of about 200 tibetan red deer still persists to the north of the yarlung tsangpo river close to the village of zhenqi. as this is the only known viable population of this deer, it is planned to establish a reserve for protection here. evidence for some other relict populations has been found around the subansiri river. they are preyed on by the himalayan wolf."}, {"title": "Aviculopecten", "chunk": "''*'' a. girtyi'' *'' a. gradicosta'' *'' a. gryphus'' *'' a. guangxiensis'' *'' a. halensis'' *'' a. hardmani'' *'' a. hataii'' *'' a. hayasakai'' *'' a. hemisphaerus'' *'' a. idahoensis'' *'' a. imbricatus'' *'' a. inspeciosus'' *'' a. jabiensis'' *'' a. jennyi'' *'' a. jiaozishanensis'' *'' a. kaibabensis'' *'' a. katwahiensis'' *'' a. keoughensis'' *'' a. khinganensis'' *'' a. kunlunensis'' *'' a. langdaiensis'' *'' a. latrobensis'' *'' a. lobanovae'' *'' a. lopingensis'' *'' a. malayensis'' *'' a. mayesensis'' *'' a. mazonensis'' *'' a. mccoyi'' *'' a. media'' *'' a. minutum'' *'' a. misrikhanensis'' *'' a. moorei'' *'' a. morahensis'' *'' a. morrowensis'' *'' a. multilineatus'' *'' a. multiradiatus'' *'' a. nikolaewi'' *'' a. nitidus'' *'' a. nodocosta'' *'' a. occidentalis'' *'' a. onukii'' *'' a. orientalis'' *'' a. ozarkensis'' *'' a. panxianensis'' *'' a. paradoxus'' *'' a. pealei'' *'' a. peculiaris'' *'' a. pitkinensis'' *'' a. planoradiatus'' *'' a. ponderosus'' *'' a. prae"}, {"title": "Rhagio", "chunk": "##ngarius'', male *'' r. pallidipennis'' becker, 1921 *'' r. pallidistigma'' ( de meijere, 1924 ) *'' r. perdicaceus'' frey, 1954 *'' r. petrovae'' soboleva, 1989 *'' r. philippinensis'' frey, 1954 *'' r. pilosus'' yang, yang, and nagatomi, 1997 *'' r. plumbeus'' ( say, 1823 ) *'' r. poecilopterus'' bezzi, 1908 *'' r. politaeniatus'' ( bellardi, 1862 ) *'' r. pollinosus'' leonard, 1930 *'' r. pseudasticta'' yang & yang, 1994 *'' r. puellaris'' nagatomi, 1971 *'' r. pullata'' ( coquillett, 1898 ) *'' r. punctipennis'' ( say, 1823 ) *'' r. rolandi'' becker, 1921 *'' r. rondanii'' bezzi, 1908 *'' r. sabahensis'' nagatomi & nagatomi, 1990 *'' r. sardous'' szilady, 1934 *'' r. scapulifer'' ( bigot, 1887 *'' r. schmidti'' lindner, 1931 *'' r. scolopaceus'' ( linnaeus, 1758 ) \u2013 downlooker snipefly *'' r. separatus'' yang, yang, and nagatomi, 1997 *'' r. shaanxiensis'' yang & yang, 1997 *'' r. shennonganus'' yang & yang, 1991 *'' r. shimai'' nagatomi & nagatomi, 1990 *'' r. shirakii'' szilady, 1934 *'' r. sikisimanus'' nagatomi, 1972 *'' r. simushirus'' soboleva, 1989 *'' r. sinensis'' yang & yang, 1993 *'' r. singularis'' yang, yang, and nagatomi, 1997 *'' r. stigmosus'' yang, yang, and nagatomi, 1997"}, {"title": "Takydromus toyamai", "chunk": "a new species of'' takydromus'' from the ryukyu archipelago, japan, and a taxonomic redefinition of'' t. smaragdinus'' boulenger 1887 ( reptilia : lacertidae ) \".'' herpetologica'''''52'''( 1 ) : 77 \u2013 88.

the species has apparently since been extirpated from the region. no subspecies are recognised. zhuonai lake ( ) in hoh xil is known as a calving ground for the tibetan antelope. a special adaptation of the species to its high altitude habitat is the retention of the fetal version of hemoglobin even in adult animals, which provides higher oxygen affinity. the tibetan antelope is the only species of mammal where this adaptation has been documented. head details tibetan antelope feed on forbs, grasses, and sedges, often digging through the snow to obtain food in winter. their natural predators include wolves, lynx, and snow leopards, and red foxes are known to prey on young calves. tibetan antelope are gregarious, sometimes congregating in herds hundreds strong when moving between summer and winter pastures, although they are more usually found in much smaller groups, with no more than 20 individuals. the females migrate up to yearly to calving grounds in the summer, where they usually give birth to a single calf, and rejoin the males at the wintering grounds in late autumn. the rutting season lasts from november to december. males form harems of up to 12 females, although one to four is more common, and drive off other males primarily by making displays or chasing them with head down, rather than sparring directly with their horns. courtship and mating are both brief, without most of the behaviour typically seen in other antelope species, although males do commonly skim the thighs of females with a kick of their fore legs. mothers give birth to a single calf"}]}

day expedition in 2010 failed to produce any sightings. the reasons for its vanishing remained unknown. competition with other bird species and the bird hunting have played certainly an important role and as with many bird species on islands the clutches were plundered by rats. habitat loss might have played a minor role because even if 37 % of the highland forests were cleared between 1975 and 1995, a large part of its habitat still remains. = = references = ="}, {"title": "Chestnut-bellied flowerpiercer", "chunk": "of this colour on the rump. the lower breast, belly and vent are deep rufous -
