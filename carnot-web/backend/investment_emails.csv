Phillip;

This attachment is my start on your 1031 search.  From my experience, you
will probably need to park the money until we find the right investment for
you.  I have not had time to analize all of the possibilities.

Are you coming on Friday? Do you want me to drive by these properties
tomorrow, or are we going to do it Friday?

Please reply

Here is an update of our activities.

All of my standard reports should be completed by the end of next week, which will allow me to provide thorough and concise report of all positions and values.

Portfolio Management
Completed assignment of all portfolio companies to senior team members
Sold 20% stake in Paladin Resources (a UK public E&P company) for 44p totaling $25 million.  This was a good price (average price LTM of 37p), but was below the quarter end price.  Therefore, there is a Q3 loss of $6.4 million.  Andrew Marsden is managing this in London.
Completed all requirements to sell COPEL shares (a $100+ million investment in the Brazilian utility).  Began selling shares on 7/17.  Current price is approximately $14 million below carrying value of approximately $120 million.  Likely to take a couple of months to exit entire position.  Investment is carried as ""Strategic"", and any losses upon the sale will fall ""below the line"" in the sale of non-merchant asset line.  Steven Sheldon is managing this.
Completed negotiations on the sale of Utiliquest for $62.5 million.  Should sign on Thursday.  Enron had invested $11.6 million in cash (net of JEDI II) and will receive $14.3 million.  The sale will net a cash gain to Enron, but below our carrying value of $16.3 million, yielding a $2 million accounting loss.  Kevin Kuykendall is managing this.
Finalized processes to begin selling Hanover Compressor shares.  We own 4.6 million shares, which are trading at $30.00/share for a total value of $138 million.  Hanover has been hedged through Raptor.  However, the structure that was used to hedge is a costless collar that leaves Enron exposed below $34.875/share.  Therefore, at current trading levels we are facing a $23 million loss.  We are working with CSFB, which has proposed to execute a block trade sale.  However, the stock continues to decline each day, and CSFB will not make an offer until the price stabilizes.  If we have to sell at a block discount, or if the price continues to fall we could be facing a $35 million to $40 million loss.  Needless to say, we are very focused on this investment.
Losses from Venture Capital positions appear to be approximately $10 million for Q3, which is primarily the result of write-offs in the HEOF portfolio.
Net quarterly expectations: Cash proceeds received from sales - ~$250 million, losses from sales below carrying value ~$60 million ($46 million ""above the line"" and $14 million ""below the line"").  

Integration
All personnel decisions made.
Legal (Gil Melman), RAC (Randy Petersen), accounting (Hope Vargas), HR (Sheila Walton) and Tax (Jim Sandt) support personnel determined.
Everyone moving to same location (EB36) today.
Preparation of 2nd half 2001 budget (revenue and expense) still in process.  To be completed by 7/31.
Back office systems and filing systems in process of integration.  To be completed by 7/31.

Process Standardization
Mid stream of development of deal filtering, deal evaluation and due diligence, modeling, approval, portfolio management, and exit (all to be completed by 8/15).
Need to develop permanent approval process, including approval limits.

Strategy Development
Strategy is currently being vetted through a collaborative process including all senior members of the group and RAC.
Final drafting session for 5-7 page strategy/charter paper and 10 page powerpoint presentation scheduled for July 27.
Presentation of strategy to Greg and Ken is scheduled for July 30, to Jeff Skilling on August 15.

Other Issues
Given Andy Fastow's involvement with Corp Dev, and our groups need for capital, I would like to add Andy to the Investment Committee.  Please provide feedback.

Thanks,
KG

Dave,
	Just a heads-up -  it sounds like the Tammy structure may get
highlighted to the Creditors Committee soon because of the expected sale
of the Indian E&P assets.
	I believe this will bring focus on the value of assets held in
Tammy.  To the extent that there are any assets within Tammy that you
believe may be candidates for the Newco you are considering, it would be
good to identify them early - before everyone starts focusing on how
much they might bring in liquidation.
	In addition to the Indian E&P assets, I am aware of the
following assets within the two Tammy structures:
			*	Option to acquire EREC (This option will
probably be rejected)
			*	A portion of the East Coast Power
investment (may be a note)
			*	Stock of EOG Resources (subject to a FAS
125 Transaction- no economic interest)
			*	Stock of LNG Power (Atlantic) Ltd. that
I am told includes Ecoelectrica
			*	Option to acquire Portland General Stock
	Other assets may be included.  Please contact me if you have any
questions.  I plan to be out this week, but will be checking voicemail
(858-704-3302).				

						Happy Holidays,

						Joel

> Skilling's abrupt departure will raise suspicions of accounting

> To the layman on the street, it will look like we recognized funds flow
of

> (Condor) that we capitalized with a promise of Enron stock in later

> This year, with the value of our stock declining, the underlying

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

EES Europe Clinches Long-Term Outsourcing Deal With Guinness
EES Europe has signed a 15-year agreement to own and operate energy assets =
at the Park Royal Guinness Brewery in London. The deal means EES will sourc=
e gas and electricity to provide steam, compressed air, chilled water and o=
ther industrial commodities to one of the largest breweries in Europe. EES =
will also have responsibility for managing a series of energy reduction mea=
sures at the plant, designed to improve performance and reduce costs. These=
 measures will include investment in new boiler, refrigeration, compressed =
air and effluent treatment plant.

Stuart Rexrode, Vice President of EES Europe, said: ""Closing this deal was =
an outstanding effort by the entire team and is another example of the type=
 of innovative energy partnerships we are forming in the marketplace. This =
transaction, coupled with the Sainsbury's deal, has caused the industry to =
start taking notice of EES, and I am confident more customers will be knock=
ing on our door looking for similar structures.""

Congratulations to everyone on the team for their dedication!

Enron signs first long-term dry bulk shipping freight origination deal with=
 major Japanese player
Enron's shipping freight team has signed a 10-year time charter deal for a =
178,000 tonne capesize vessel with Lepta Shipping (with a performance guara=
ntee from Mitsui & Co Ltd, Tokyo, Japan)   The agreement has a notional val=
ue of USD60 million and a mark-to-market value of USD 5 million.  The new a=
greement gives Enron the option to buy the vessel in Japanese yen after the=
 third year and the time charter period itself can be extended by us by up =
to an additional four years, if required.  The agreement takes effect from =
the latter part of 2003 when the ship itself, currently being manufactured =
in the Imabari shipyard in Japan or any similar substitute vessel, becomes =
available.  ""We are already in the process of onselling the first three yea=
rs of our time charter above the curve ,"" announces Pierre Aury, who heads =
up Enron's dry bulk freight team.  ""This deal gives us a strategic long ""da=
ys"" position and we now expect to close further deals as a result of our dr=
ive to commoditise more time charter transactions.""  The team is already ex=
ploring new time charter deals in the scarcer cape-size and handy-size vess=
el market.  A combined effort between the legal, tax, credit, transport sup=
port and structuring teams was instrumental in helping to book this deal ju=
st in time for Q2.  The shipping freight team is already working on a new s=
tructured deal with a major UK bank, so watch this space for future announc=
ements...

Enron Credit Closes Deal with Enron's Shipping Desk
On 8 August, 2001 Enron's shipping desk bought a Digital  Bankruptcy Swap (=
DBS) from Enron Credit in order to buy protection against a Japanese indust=
rial/trading counterparty.  Under the terms of the deal the shipping desk w=
ill receive pay-out from Enron Credit when this counterparty becomes insolv=
ent under Japanese laws and therefore hedges the counterparty risk that  th=
e desk holds when transacting with this Japanese counterparty.  When the le=
vel of the shipping desk's mark to market profit rises above a certain amou=
nt, the desk will also have the ability to buy additional DBS protection.  =
Similarly, if the desk's contract with the Japanese counterparty terminates=
 earlier, the desk can sell back any unused DBS cover to Enron Credit.

""We needed to increase our credit capacity with this counterparty in order =
to do more deals and then realised that Enron Credit could help us,"" said P=
ierre Aury who heads up the freight team. ""Another driver was that we felt =
we needed to set a foot in the DBS market in order to go up the learning cu=
rve and develop shipping specific DBSs for the near future."" ""The hedge bet=
ween these two commercial groups is another milestone in Enron's internal r=
isk management.  With each commercial group having to optimise its capital =
at risk, the services and tools Enron Credit has on offer are an excellent =
complement to our already sophisticated RAC process,"" commented Ted Murphy,=
 Head of RAC in Europe.

Congratulations go to Andrew Feachem who originated the deal for Enron Cred=
it and Pierre Aury.

Dear All,

	As many of you may already know, I will be moving to the Power Trading group.  My new position will allow me to combine my experience in derivatives, as well as my knowledge of the power industry.  

?	My derivatives experience:  Recently, I worked on Credit Derivatives pricing models for Enron Credit.  In addition, I worked as a derivatives structurer at Investment Banque BNP Paribas in London, where I also obtained my licenses in Securities, Regulations and Derivatives.  In addition, I spent my summers in Associateships and consulting positions in derivatives pricing at Salomon Brothers and Charles Schwab. Finally, I conducted real options academic research at MIT.

?	My power experience:  My Harvard PhD thesis in Applied Mathematics had applications to the ""transient stability analysis of electrical power systems.""  In addition, my London Business School MBA thesis was entitled ""Day-Ahead Lunch-Time Electricity Demand Forecasting:  Applications to Electricity and Weather Derivatives"".  


I really enjoyed my time working in the Research Group, as well as my time supporting Enron Credit.  

Looking forward to working with you in the future!


Kind regards,
Iris

Guys, I would like to add the following commentary to the DASH which will 
better reflect my thinking around this investment.  The current text suggests 
that there is significant strategic advantage for ENA to be a participant in 
the fund.  I do not think that is the case; however, I do see some merits in 
the investment based on the needs of Enron's Global Finance group.  I would 
suggest toning down the strategic advantages and add the following:

 It is unlikely that given the funds target returns that the it will be an 
effective permanent monetization vehicle for ENA's strategic and merchant   
investments; however, Enron Global Finance believes that the investment is 
important for the following reasons:
  a) provides an additional ""Friend of Enron"" to facilitate short to medium 
term balance sheet and regulatory solution to highly structured    commodity 
and capital transactions in the wholesale group;
  b) provides alternative sources of short term capital liquidity and
  c) by further developing the relationship with AIG provides collateral 
benefits for Enron's overall Global Finance capability and business.

ENA would have a requirement that this investments be hedged through Raptor 
and be managed by the Enron Global Finance Group.

Regards

Hello, following up our PGE Budget presentation I am forwarding you the
following information.

Jessica - the 2002 Capital Slide has been revised to be consistent with
the NNG disclosure schedule.  The decommissioning forecast is up by $1.6
MM, however since this is funded by the decommissioning trust it should
not be an issue.

Tracy - Do you have a time and agenda set for the Nov. 1 dry run of the
budget presentation?  I may be sitting in for Piro so please keep me
posted as to what the plan is.

Rod - you asked for some detail on our IT capital expenditures.  The
file IT_Teresa includes the requested detail.  Note that in our UE-115
ratecase we were authorized to expend up to $96.8 MM for the  2000-2002
budget years. This is a balancing account, such that if we don't expend
the money we have to refund it to customers.  As an fyi - I've pasted in
below the language from our UE-115 Stipulation on IT costs.


Q.  What is the basis for the stipulation relating to issue S-45, CIS /
IT Disallowance?

A.  After a Staff review of new IT systems and their associated capital
costs, Staff has determined PGE's capital costs for new IT systems to be
prudent.  As a result, the Parties agreed to full recovery of PGE's IT
investments, subject to a Staff audit.  PGE will place into base rates
100% of the 2002 revenue requirement related to the 2000, 2001, and 2002
capital additions for the CIS/IT capital items listed below.  The 2002
revenue requirement included in base rates will be trued-up to the
actual revenue requirement for the CIS/IT capital costs.  OPUC Staff
will audit PGE's actual capital expenditures for the CIS/IT capital
items listed below.

1. Customer information system.
2. Enterprise resources planning (ERP) system.
3. Network meter reading (NMR) backbone and data store (excluding the
meters).
4. Miscellaneous capitalized information technology costs.

Some of the forecasted 2000-2002 capital additions may be delayed until
2003.  Delayed costs can also be recovered, subject to the same Staff
audit procedures and standards.  Only those costs that are reasonable
and prudent will be authorized for inclusion in the ""actual"" revenue
requirement calculation.  Accordingly, customers will receive a refund
for any costs PGE does not expend or costs the OPUC finds imprudent.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Attached are the latest available Daily Position Report files for the 4 
Raptor vehicles which include spreadsheets detailing what is hedged within 
each vehicle.  One thing that I forgot to mention in our meeting yesterday is 
that there is considerable indecision as to whether or not Raptor 4 will be 
included in the cross-guarantees, so we will need to have a value with or 
without Raptor 4.  I will send a follow-up e-mail with the latest drafts 
available for the cross guarantees.  Let me know as questions arise.  Thanks 
again.

That may work -  I don't want to end up with an equity position I just worked 
hard to eliminate. Further, raptor may be a good accounting hedge but if we 
took back JEDI's share at existing marks we would be destroying significant 
real value. Will the buy back price of the equity/debt we get back from JEDI 
incorporate the write downs we think should occur?

Dave, I assume you are asking how we hedge the portion of JEDI II investments 
that will come back to us after the restructuring. As any buyout price for 
CALPERS will reflect the state of the assets at closing, I think we are well 
hedged until the closing of the restructuring. We can see if we can reserve 
some Raptor capacity upfront to hege us moving forward from the restructuring 
closin. If this does not answer your question, let me know.    Mike

Some Merrill Executives Had Stakes in Enron Partnership --- Investments Raise Conflict-of-Interest Questions

Nearly 100 Merrill Lynch & Co. executives invested more than $16 million of their own money in a controversial partnership the securities firm was selling for Enron Corp., even as other senior Merrill officials decided to turn down the offer, people close to Merrill said. 
Among the top Merrill officials who put their own money into the Enron partnership were current Vice Chairman Thomas Davis; Daniel Bayly, Merrill's investment-banking chief; and Schuyler Tilney, who heads Merrill's energy investment-banking department and directly oversees the firm's dealing with Enron on corporate-finance matters, the people said.
Though each executive invested less than $1 million, the people said, their involvement highlights the role played by senior Wall Street officials in helping to create some of the partnerships Enron used to pad its earnings and hide debt from investors -- and that eventually resulted in huge losses that led to the energy-trading company's downfall. 
Mr. Davis, Mr. Tilney and Mr. Bayly didn't return calls for comment. Joseph Cohen, a Merrill spokesman, said the investments were entirely appropriate, and common on Wall Street. 
The personal investments were part of a total of $22 million Merrill and its officials committed to invest in the partnership, known as LJM2 Co-Investment LP. This partnership was particularly controversial because it allowed some Enron officials to make far more money working part time on the partnerships than they did working full time for Enron. The energy company has estimated, for instance, that Andrew Fastow, whom Enron replaced as chief financial officer in October as pressures on the company mounted, made more than $30 million since 1999 running LJM2 and a smaller partnership, called LJM Cayman LP. 
At issue for Merrill is the potential for conflicts of interest. Merrill, like other Wall Street firms, wore a number of hats with Enron: The securities firm acted at various times as securities underwriter and investor with the energy company. Since 1990, Merrill was among the top five underwriters of Enron's stock and bond deals, according to Thomson Financial, earning fees for helping to raise about $3.7 billion in securities issues for the company. Thus, some critics question whether Merrill officials would let their personal investments with Enron entities interfere with their business decisions in dealing with the energy company. 
""Merrill's involvement as underwriter for Enron and its executives' investments raises serious conflict-of-interest questions,"" says Jacob Zamansky, a New York-based plaintiffs' lawyer. ""It gives the appearance that Merrill did this to get Enron deals. Merrill had a vested interest in . . . the partnership and investing"" in it. 
There are other conflicts as well, securities lawyers say. Some top executives at Merrill declined to invest their money because they believed that the Enron partnership -- which kept assets off Enron's balance sheet -- wouldn't get the best investments, which would be kept by the corporate parent. Another concern: Enron's Mr. Fastow suggested the idea of investing in the partnership to Mr. Tilney, whose wife until last week was a managing director of Enron's energy-services unit. Mr. Fastow through a spokesman had no comment. 
It is unclear if top Merrill executives, who also worked on Enron's financings, had more information about the nature of the LJM2 partnership than Merrill's individual customers who were offered opportunities to invest in the partnership. ""I'm not saying that Merrill violated the law here,"" says John Coffee, a professor of securities law at Columbia University in New York. ""But this is a big public-policy issue. Merrill has an obligation, because Enron is a client, not to reveal some confidential information, but it also has a fiduciary obligation to its investors to tell them if these securities aren't suitable for them."" 
Mr. Cohen, the Merrill spokesman, brushes aside such concerns. ""The investment partnership was reviewed and deemed appropriate by parties on all sides of the transaction,"" Mr. Cohen said, reading from a prepared statement. ""Consistent with common industry practice, it was offered to qualified external as well as internal investors, and this is not a conflict of interest."" 
Mr. Cohen added that Merrill high-net-worth clients ""in the partnership offering were given the same information as all Merrill executives who wanted to invest."" 
Mr. Davis, who at the time of the investment headed the institutional-securities group, appears to be the only official on Merrill's executive committee to have invested in the partnership. Even though close to 100 Merrill executives invested in the partnership, neither Chief Executive Officer David Komansky nor his heir apparent, President E. Stanley O'Neal, were in the group, people close to the deal said. One person with knowledge of the matter said some top executives balked at investing their own money because they were uncomfortable with some LJM2 investments. Mr. Davis, however, headed the institutional group, which counted Enron as one of its big clients. 
Merrill, which helped market LJM2 to more than three dozen institutional and individual investors, was only one of many Wall Street firms to invest in the $386.6 million partnership. Other corporate investors in the partnership included Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., two units of Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston, Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., First Union Corp. and the CIBC World Markets unit of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. 
The funds for a $15 million investment from J.P. Morgan Chase came from the private-equity unit of J.P. Morgan, which invests the firm's own funds. While individual Morgan bankers may have stakes in those funds, they didn't have any direct, separate stakes in LJM2, a spokeswoman said. 
At Citigroup and Lehman Brothers, which committed $10 million each, and CIBC World Markets, which committed $15 million, the funds came from the firms' own assets and not from outside clients or individual investment bankers, according to people familiar with the investments. 
Officials declined to comment at CSFB, a unit of Credit Suisse Group, whose DLJ Fund Investment Partners III LP made a $5 million commitment, while a CSFB affiliate named Merchant Capital Inc. committed $10 million. Company representatives had no comment at Deutsche Bank, where an affiliate of its former Bankers Trust unit, BT Investment Partners, committed $10 million, and First Union, whose First Union Investors Inc. committed $25 million. 
Officials at some of these Wall Street firms said their investment committees felt pressured to make the investments in order to stay in the running for investment-banking assignments. Some bankers were concerned about whether they were being asked to make uneconomical investments in corporate castoffs that wouldn't appreciate in value. Indeed, it is unclear what returns, if any, the LJM2 partnership investment has generated for limited partners and investors. 
Wall Street securities firms have long made investments associated with their investment-banking business. Sometimes the investments are made to provide extra capital to help clients complete deals. Sometimes the investments are used to acquire an asset a client wants to sell. The funds may come from the securities firm itself, from investment clients, or individuals at the firm who may be offered the chance to make the investments as part of their compensation packages. 
What was unusual about the Merrill investment in the Enron vehicle was that some senior bankers chose not to participate out of concern about what the partnership would invest in. In addition, some of Merrill's top executives, including Mr. Komansky, Merrill's chief executive, had been embarrassed in 1998 by disclosure that they had taken personal stakes in Long-Term Capital Management, the highflying hedge fund for which Merrill had raised funds and whose near collapse jeopardized the entire U.S. financial system.

How to be an Enron millionaire
According to former colleagues, two executives reaped million-dollar windfalls by investing $6,000 apiece in the company's partnership scam. A case study in corporate rot.
- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Jake Tapper
Jan. 29, 2002 | When she heard that Kristina Mordaunt had been mixed up in Enron's infamous LJM partnership, Julia Murray broke down in tears. 
Murray, an Enron in-house counsel, wasn't known within the firm for such emotional displays. Enron was a hard-charging company that attracted tough-as-nails Type A executives and lawyers. But Kristina Mordaunt, a fellow Enron attorney who had worked in the counsel's office before joining the company's financial division, was Murray's close friend. And the news about her was rather shocking: On Nov. 7, 2001, Mordaunt was fired and escorted from the Enron building in downtown Houston by company security. According to four current or former Enron executives, Mordaunt was fired after the company found that she had made a windfall profit off LJM, one of the controversial -- and possibly illegal -- partnerships set up by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
According to these sources, there is a lesson in Kristina Mordaunt's downfall. The ignominious exit of employees like Mordaunt, who had enjoyed the trust and respect of fellow company attorneys and managers, shows how Enron's corporate culture rotted from within, under the twin pressures of financial ambition and personal greed. 
A few weeks before Mordaunt was fired, Enron had announced that her former boss Fastow was on a ""leave of absence."" But few inside the company expected him back. On Oct. 31, Enron had reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission had upgraded its interest in the company's financial dealings from an inquiry to a formal investigation. Within Enron, the board of directors set up a special internal committee to investigate the company's convoluted finances as well. Soon, according to the four Enron sources, the committee stumbled upon stunning news: Working with Fastow, Mordaunt and Enron treasurer Ben Glisan had invested around $6,000 apiece in LJM, one of the limited partnerships Enron had established to hide its debt. Within a few weeks, they each made approximately $1 million from those investments. Enron later revealed that Fastow himself, the financial wizard behind the partnerships scheme, earned as much as $30 million from his role in managing the partnerships. 
Due to Enron's complex -- some think purposely confusing -- financial arrangements, those numbers could not be confirmed with documentation, though they were reported to Salon by the four current or former Enron executives. A congressional investigator also informed Salon that his committee has been given the same information and is currently trying to verify the charge. 
What is clear is that Mordaunt and Glisan were key members of the team Fastow worked with to set up these questionable partnerships, and they appear to have benefited dramatically. ""Mordaunt, for all practical purposes, was Fastow's lawyer at Enron"" since she was ""the top lawyer in his division,"" at the time, said one former Enron executive. After working for Fastow, Mordaunt later became chief counsel for a separate Enron division called EBS -- which itself was involved in highly questionable accounting activities. 
Mordaunt could not be reached for comment by Salon, but according to a former Enron employee, ""She has told people that she doesn't think she did anything wrong."" 
Glisan declined to comment. ""I've been advised not to talk to anybody,"" he told Salon. Glisan referred calls to his attorney, Hank Schuelke, with the Washington, D.C., law firm Janis Schuelke & Wechsler. Asked about the allegation against Glisan, Bill Shields, an attorney with the firm, said only, ""We're not going to have any comment."" 
So far, according to the congressional investigator, the world knows ""just the tip of the iceberg"" about what drove Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest company, into the biggest U.S. bankruptcy of all time, depriving investors and employees of at least $1 billion. Up to this point, most of the public's attention has been focused on Enron's political connections and the failure of Wall Street's so-called gatekeepers -- the analysts, banks, credit agencies and analysts -- to sound a warning bell. But the inside story of Enron's corporate culture -- as the company transformed itself from an energy trader whose business was rooted in the physical delivery of gas and electricity into a high-finance wheeler-dealer whose business was primarily manipulating numbers -- is just coming to light. This part of the story is about greed, betrayal and deception -- and its human costs, in broken friendships, ruined careers and worse. 
The apparent suicide of former Enron vice chairman J. Clifford Baxter on Friday might be the most dramatic example so far of this human cost. But Enron's corporate ranks have been suffering many shocks since last fall -- and the revelation about Mordaunt and Glisan was one of them. Many executives were stunned to learn that these two trusted co-workers and friends had been raking in such extraordinary amounts of cash. Though Julia Murray declined to comment to Salon, her tearful reaction to the news about her friend Mordaunt last November indicate the deep emotional wounds inflicted by some of Enron's suddenly rich managers as they grabbed their cash and ran for the door.
""Did I feel betrayed? Yeah, a lot,"" said an Enron executive and friend of both Mordaunt and Glisan who would speak with Salon only on the condition of anonymity. ""I was extremely surprised."" 
After the news about Mordaunt and Glisan broke inside the company, colleagues rushed to see who else might have been involved in the scandal. After Mordaunt was escorted out of the Enron building, said one executive, ""I called a number of people I know who work in the finance division and said, 'Please tell me that you didn't invest in LJM!"" 
LJM along with LJM2 and Chewco have become the most notorious of the shady accounting partnerships set up by Enron. Set up, it is now believed, specifically to hide Enron debt from public scrutiny, the partnerships proved to be the catalyst for Enron's fall. 
On Nov. 8, 2001, the same day the company announced that its financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 ""should not be relied upon,"" Enron filed an ""8-K"" form -- an interim document required for certain types of financial events -- with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In that form, <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/> Enron disclosed that some of the ""limited partners"" in the partnerships ""were, at the time of the investment, non-executive officers or employees of Enron."" Enron also announced that it was ""terminating the employment"" of Glisan and Mordaunt for participating in the LJM partnerships. 
""At the time these individuals invested in the limited partnership, LJM1 had ceased entering into new transactions with Enron,"" Enron's 8-K stated. ""However, some pre-existing investments involving LJM1 and Enron were still in effect, and Enron believes that these investments resulted in distributions or payments to LJM1 and to the limited partnership in which these individuals invested."" 
According to the congressional investigator, Mordaunt reaped her LJM windfall after she was approached by an Enron executive, who asked her if she wanted to make some money. Yes, she said. ""Give me a check for $6,000,"" he told her, according to the congressional investigator. Later, the executive asked Mordaunt for her bank account number so he could deposit the proceeds from her investment. ""How much is it?"" she asked. He told her to check her bank account the next day. When she did, she discovered over $1 million had been deposited into her account. The congressional committee is currently investigating the matter. 
The Nov. 8 SEC filing also clarified Fastow's role in the company. He was no longer officially on a leave of absence. He ""is no longer working for Enron,"" the filing stated. 
At a November news conference, then-CEO Kenneth Lay reported that he knew about the partnerships but not about Mordaunt's and Glisan's role in them. 
Asked last week about the allegations against Mordaunt and Glisan, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said, ""I have no idea."" Palmer noted that a special committee had been appointed ""to look into"" such matters. ""I know they're looking into everything surrounding those transactions,"" he said, referring to the partnerships. 
Said another former Enron executive after hearing about Mordaunt's and Glisan's lucrative deals: ""Hillary Clinton should have gone to their school of futures trading."" 
To many of their former colleagues, Mordaunt's and Glisan's closeness to Fastow's suspicious transactions makes things look even worse. ""To many of us, this looks and smells like a bribe,"" said one Enron former employee. ""'I' -- Fastow -- 'will give you money, you shut up.' Or put another way, 'Here is the payoff for helping me set up the structures that helped me rake in more than $30 million.'"" The two weren't merely ""Enron executives,"" the former employee says, ""they were the treasurer and one of the top lawyers in the company. And both of them worked on LJM-related deals. That is what makes it sickening."" 
The accusations highlight the personal betrayal many Enron executives feel. After Mordaunt and Glisan were fired last November, their former colleagues spent much time trying to figure out how it all could have happened. 
Mordaunt, according to a current Enron executive, ""was very tight with Andy [Fastow]. Andy was responsible for making her managing director, and she would have done anything for him."" Nonetheless, as a lawyer, Mordaunt should have known better, the executive said. ""Given his connection with LJM, which was dicey at best and at worst probably illegal, I personally would have stayed far away from it. But you never know how Andy spun it to her."" 
After working as Fastow's top lawyer, Mordaunt later served as chief counsel for EBS, an Enron subsidiary set up specifically to handle another complex partnership, code-named Braveheart. In Braveheart, Enron sold 10 years' worth of future revenue from a broadband interactive television deal it was setting up with Blockbuster. Although the deal itself never went past the testing stage, Enron booked $110 million worth of revenue for selling off those future, never-to-be-realized earnings. 
Glisan also played a key role in Fastow's division, a former Enron executive noted: ""All the deals we did had to go through Glisan and get his approval because of the impact on funds flow."" The former executive, like others affiliated with the firm, said that he once had a positive impression of Glisan and was surprised to learn that he had been an LJM investor. 
To some current and former Enron executives, the transformation of respected managers like Mordaunt and Glisan represented a major shift in the company ethos. ""In my opinion this all goes back to when Jeff Skilling took over and Enron ceased being an energy company and we became an earnings company,"" said one former executive, referring to Enron's metamorphosis into a company that focused more on highly complex financial-derivatives trading than on actual commodities. 
In 1997, Skilling became the company's president and chief operating officer. Press accounts of Enron's rise traditionally gave him credit for Enron's increasing focus on complex financing schemes and risky leaps into such areas as bandwidth trading, an enterprise that ended up costing the company hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Skilling was ""all hype,"" the one-time executive says. ""Everything he did was to hype the stock. And they had this need to create complex financial dealings to hide all the things going wrong. 
""Once we became an earnings-focused company, that was the beginning of the end."" The former executive said he's still unsure whether recently resigned CEO Lay knew everything that was going on. ""But that doesn't excuse him. Captain Joe Hazelwood didn't know that the guy was going to run the Valdez into the reef. But he was Captain Hazelwood. It was his ship."" 
The company's business practices changed under Skilling, this former executive said. And so did the attitudes of managers like Mordaunt and Glisan -- and Lay, for that matter. Keeping the stock price up, at all costs, became the order of the day, even if that meant telling employees all was fine, when in fact the company's situation was rapidly deteriorating. 
""[Lay] lied to us starting in August,"" said the former executive. ""He lied to us."" In August, Lay went before the company and announced that Skilling was resigning for personal reasons. In an all-employees meeting, Lay told a touching tale about why Skilling felt the need to leave the company. 
Skilling, Lay said, had recently visited the Teesside Power Station, Enron's gas-fired power plant in northeast England, where an Aug. 8 explosion and fire had killed three Enron employees. ""It shook him up so much he realized how much he had sacrificed with his own family,"" one executive recalled Lay saying. ""And he wanted to spend more time with his kids."" Lay then told the company more lies, according to the executive: that Enron had just enjoyed the best quarter in its history; that it was going to be more friendly to Wall Street; it was going to simplify its accounting practices; there were no other people other than Fastow involved in the shady partnerships. 
""About two weeks later, the news came out about Ben Glisan and Kristina Mordaunt,"" recalled the executive. Soon afterward, the company was told that ""we would have to restate our earnings for the past five years."" 
Then came the news that executives like Lay had been dumping their stock for years while simultaneously telling stockholders and employees that all was fine and the stock would soon bounce back. In hindsight, few Enron executives believe that Skilling's departure had anything to do with the Teesside Power Station tragedy. 
""Lay got in front of the entire company and just lied,"" said the executive, who has lost his life savings. ""I feel like a schmuck.""

Enron Directors Backed Moving Debt Off Books

Members of Enron Corp.'s board of directors received detailed briefings as early as four years ago about the purpose and structure of controversial partnerships whose losses triggered the company's fall into bankruptcy, according to minutes of the meetings. 
The minutes, which cover four board meetings in 1997 and 1999 and three meetings of the board's finance committee in 2000, suggest that board members approved aggressive accounting actions, including moving debt off the company books.
A dozen congressional committees as well as the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Enron's collapse, which cost investors and employees billions of dollars. A focus of the inquiries is whether Enron hid debt and inflated its profits by using the private partnerships run by its chief financial officer. 
In other Enron-related news yesterday, the General Accounting Office announced that it would sue the White House for access to records of Vice President Cheney's meetings with Enron and other industry interests that sought to influence the administration's energy policy last year. And Stephen Cooper, the interim head of Enron, said he was optimistic the company could survive, though in a much diminished form. 
Individual Enron board members, who themselves are being sued and investigated, have said little publicly about their role in the transactions that toppled the company. The minutes, made available to The Washington Post by a source critical of the board, suggest that the partnerships were a key part of Enron's growth strategy and show they were regularly reviewed by the directors. 
The copies of the minutes do not cover every board meeting and do not include documents that are referred to as being attached to the summaries of the board's actions. 
When it was reported last fall that Andrew Fastow, the Enron CFO, made $30 million running partnerships with names such as LJM, Raptor and JEDI, then-chairman Kenneth L. Lay announced that the board was setting up a special committee to investigate. The minutes show that members of that special committee attended board meetings in which Fastow described the intricacy of the entities. 
Sources said the committee's report, which is expected to be completed as early as tomorrow, will say that while the Enron board approved the partnerships, management and auditors withheld key information from them. That is expected to be the key element of the defense that will be offered by Lay and board member William C. Powers Jr. when they testify before Congress on Monday, sources said. Last night, Robert Bennett, a Washington lawyer representing Enron, gave every indication that would be the case. 
""While the board of directors, including Mr. Lay, were aware that these special partnership entities were being set up, which were being run by Mr. Fastow, there is a great deal of information regarding their operation and execution that was unknown to the board of directors,"" Bennett said. 
At an Oct. 11, 1999, board meeting, Fastow discussed the company's mix of ""on-balance and off-balance sheet debt,"" according to the minutes. At another meeting on May 1, 2000, Fastow told board members about the risk of ""accounting scrutiny"" on the Raptor partnership. 
A board resolution in October 1999 said one purpose of the LJM2 partnership was to create ""a potential ready purchaser of the company's businesses and assets."" A chart labeled ""LJM2 Update,"" attached to the agenda for a May 2000 finance committee meeting, said the partnership had made seven investments, all purchased from Enron. 
Enron has disclosed that the board waived the company's conflict-of-interest rules to let Fastow oversee the partnerships. 
The board's special committee hired William R. McLucas, former head of enforcement at the SEC, to do the investigation and write a report for the committee. The report is expected to be released before Lay, who resigned last week, and board member Powers, who is also dean of the University of Texas law school, testify before Congress on Monday. 
Until now, Congress has focused on the role Enron's outside auditor, Arthur Andersen, played in the company's collapse and the reported destruction by Andersen executives of Enron-related documents. Monday's hearings are expected to zero in on the behavior of Enron officials, including the board. 
The outside directors are expected, as part of their defense, to push the focus back on Andersen, sources say. They will point, for example, to portions of board minutes that say Andersen ""had spent considerable time analyzing . . . the governance structure"" of one of the partnerships, LJM2, and ""was comfortable with the proposed transaction."" 
Minutes from October 1999 and October 2000 say the board ordered several safeguards be implemented to maintain control of the partnerships. One was allowing Lay or the board to remove Fastow from one partnership, LJM, at any time. Another was directing then-Enron chief executive Jeffrey K. Skilling and others to review all transactions between Enron and LJM. And Skilling was to review Fastow's ""economic interest"" in the partnership. 
Bennett said, ""We have learned that many of the procedures that were put into place to ensure the appropriate operation of these entities were not complied with, without the knowledge of the board."" 
Patrick McGurn of Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. of Rockville, which advises large shareholders on corporate-governance issues, said last night that the minutes seem to provide more evidence that board members were fully informed of the company's aggressive financial strategies. 
""If that's not the case, the directors better start talking and start talking now. Every step along the way it seems this board had the opportunity to say no to the partnerships, to the waiver of the ethics code, and each time they had an opportunity to take the right fork in the road, they took the wrong fork."" 
The Oct. 12, 1999, minutes show that outside director Herbert Winokur -- now a member of the board's special investigating committee -- recommended that the board approve Fastow's participation in the LJM2 partnership. 
McGurn said, ""The first principle of an investigation is that the people who presumably might be held responsible at the end of the day can't investigate themselves."" 
The other two members of the special committee -- Powers and Raymond S. Troubh, a New York consultant -- had no involvement with the company when the formation of the off-balance-sheet entities took place, sources close to the company said. 
W. Neil Eggleston, an attorney for the outside directors of the board, said Winokur has no conflict of interest in serving on that special committee, despite his role in approving the partnership deals. ""It was important for the special committee to render its report quickly and Mr. Winokur's participation provided continuity and speed to the special committee's efforts,"" Eggleston said. 
The board minutes show that as early as Dec. 9, 1997, Enron's executive committee approved a buyout -- that included a corporate guarantee of $633 million -- of the interest of the California public employees pension fund in the JEDI partnership. 
At an Aug. 7, 2000, meeting of the finance committee, chaired by Winokur, the off-balance-sheet partnerships are described as ""the vehicles the company was utilizing to manage its balance sheet debt."" Directors Wendy Gramm and Lay were among other board members that also attended the meeting. 
At a special board meeting on June 28, 1999, Lay called on Skilling to discuss a proposed investment partnership. ""Mr. Skilling noted that due to changes in the accounting treatment of off-balance-sheet transactions, the company had been analyzing new types of financing vehicles. He called on Mr. Fastow to discuss the proposal."" 
Skilling resigned suddenly in August. Fastow was ousted in October. 
The LJM partnerships were specifically cited by the company last fall when it admitted violating some accounting standards, resulting in a $586 million overstatement of its profits between 1997 and 2001. 
The excerpts that became available yesterday give no hint that board members had questions or qualms about the accounting maneuvers, with the exception of Fastow's dual role as Enron's chief financial officer and LJM's manager. 
Staff writers David Hilzenrath, Albert B. Crenshaw and Carrie Johnson contributed to this report. Peter Behr reported from Houston.

Concerned ex-worker was sent to human resources
House panel asks Lay to explain what happened to memo from former energy services manager 
By JULIE MASON 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau 
Jan. 30, 2002, 10:04PM
WASHINGTON -- A one-time Enron Corp. manager who warned Chairman Ken Lay in August about questionable accounting practices was sent to human resources for a talk about employee morale, her attorney said Wednesday. 
House investigators demand Lay explain Enron's response to allegations raised in an Aug. 28 e-mail by Margaret Ceconi, who had lost her job with Enron Energy Services just over three weeks earlier. 
""Ms. Ceconi included her home phone number in the e-mail and offered to speak to board members,"" lawmakers from the House Energy and Commerce Committee said in a letter to Lay. ""We are very interested in learning what happened to Ms. Ceconi's e-mail after you received it, and how Enron responded to it."" 
An Enron spokesman did not return a call for comment. 
A key issue for investigators probing the collapse of Enron is at what point executives at the company became aware of financial problems and how those problems were addressed. 
Ceconi on Aug. 28 wrote a five-page memo to Lay, stating that losses in Enron Energy Services, or EES, were being moved to another sector of Enron to make EES appear profitable. 
According to Ceconi, the losses were hidden in Enron Wholesale Services, the company's highly profitable and well-established trading arm. 
""Some would say the house of cards are falling,"" Ceconi said in her memo to Lay. 
Demetrios Anaipakos, Ceconi's Houston attorney, said Lay never met with Ceconi to discuss her concerns, and she was instead referred to human resources. 
""During that meeting, the primary discussion was focused on concerns over employee morale at Enron,"" Anaipakos said. 
Ceconi's memo, which was copied to a manager in human resources, detailed morale problems and related issues at EES. 
Ceconi was told her accounting allegations would be taken seriously and investigated by Enron, but she never heard back, according to her lawyer. 
""Ms. Ceconi firmly believes the allegations she raised in her memo merited response from the company, and she didn't get one,"" Anaipakos said. 
The House Energy and Commerce Committee sent Lay 10 questions pertaining to Ceconi's memo and the company's response. Lay has until Feb. 12 to respond. 
Questions posed to Lay in a letter signed by Rep. W.J. ""Billy"" Tauzin, R-La., committee chairman, and other members seek details on how the memo was distributed and whether Ceconi's allegations were investigated.

Enron Taps $3 Billion From Bank Lines In Pre-Emptive Move to Ensure Liquidi=

Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available bank cred=
it lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liqu=
idity.=20
Enron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about $1.85 billion of =
outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- according to a=
 person familiar with the matter, with the remainder providing the energy c=
oncern with a cash cushion. Some observers believe the move is a pre-emptiv=
e step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access =
to bank lines be interrupted. The person also said Enron was talking to its=
 banks about a new, multibillion-dollar credit line.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong.=
 But, ""when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last =
few days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank,"" s=
aid an Enron spokesman. In a statement, the company's new chief financial o=
fficer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, ""we are mak=
ing it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate=
 liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments.""=20
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over=
 the Houston energy-trading concern in the past 10 days. Enron is the natio=
n's largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all e=
lectricity and natural-gas trades. Yesterday, for example, Enron was involv=
ed in about $4 billion of deals through its EnronOnline unit.=20
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. Last week, it=
 reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder =
equity of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange =
Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transaction=
s it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer, And=
rew S. Fastow, who was replaced Wednesday.=20
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency, Fitch, pu=
t Enron on review for a possible downgrade, while another, Standard & Poor'=
s, changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investor=
s Service already has said it is looking at a possible downgrade of Enron. =
In order to fall below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have t=
o fall several notches.=20
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. T=
ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment-grade ra=
ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions=
 of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue mi=
llions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of ex=
isting shares. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enro=
n was down six cents at $16.35.=20
Liquidity is a key issue for Enron, which handles energy-trading volumes mo=
re than triple its next-biggest competitor, American Electric Power Co. Enr=
on's EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform has transacted more than $=
884 billion of trades since it was created in November 1999.=20
The company's wildly successful wholesale unit has been dragged down by und=
erperforming assets elsewhere in the company, chiefly the approximately $6.=
5 billion of international assets such as its Dabhol power project in India=
. Raising cash and retiring debt largely is a timing issue. The cash needs =
of its trading operation are immediate; it takes time to sell assets, parti=
cularly in today's slower economy.=20
The company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies tha=
t have damaged its credibility, particularly in connection with its dealing=
s with Mr. Fastow, the former chief financial officer. Internal documents r=
elated to one of the Fastow partnerships disclose that Enron also did as mu=
ch as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected =
to another company official, who has since left Enron. While Enron disclose=
d its Fastow-related transactions in SEC filings, a computerized search of =
the SEC's database of public filings produced no reference to this other em=
ployee-related entity known as Chewco.=20
Chewco was established in 1997 ""with approximately $400 million in capital =
commitments"" to buy an interest in Enron assets, according to one of the pa=
rtnerships documents. The document didn't further specify what assets were =
purchased, and it didn't disclose the financial impact of the transactions =
for either Chewco or Enron. Chewco was being run by Michael Kopper, a manag=
ing director in Enron's Global Equity Markets Group, according to the docum=
ent.=20
Enron, which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with em=
ployee-related entities were legal and properly disclosed, didn't have any =
comment regarding its dealings with Chewco.=20
Mr. Kopper, who Enron says left the company this year to focus on helping t=
o run the Fastow-related partnerships, didn't return phone calls. A person =
at his office in Houston yesterday said Mr. Kopper was traveling. In respon=
se to questions about Chewco, an Enron spokesman would say only that ""Micha=
el Kopper was never an executive officer of Enron."" Mr. Fastow repeatedly h=
as declined interview requests. He severed his relationships with the partn=
erships in July.=20
This statement is an apparent reference to SEC disclosure regulations regar=
ding related-party transactions. Under SEC rule S-K, a company has to repor=
t any transaction that exceeds $60,000 and involves ""any director or execut=
ive officer."" By contrast, Mr. Fastow, as CFO, would have fallen into that =
category, but Mr. Kopper, as managing director of a business unit, presumab=
ly wouldn't have.=20
However, reporting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Bo=
ard seems to have a broader definition, one that might include Mr. Kopper. =
According to FAS Statement 57, a related-party transaction involves a ""mate=
rial"" piece of business between the company and a member of management. The=
 statement defines management as directors, top officers, vice presidents i=
n charge of major business units and ""other persons who perform similar pol=
icy-making functions. Persons without formal titles may also be members of =
management.""

Dear Investor,

This little biotech company just may have THE ANSWER
to prostate cancer...

...and a lock on one of the largest -- and most
lucrative -- health markets of the Western world.
Best of all, its stock is what I call a  ""Why the heck
not"" investment.  It's low-priced -- you can pick up a
thousand shares for around $1,200 now.  And it has the
potential to MULTIPLY that small investment 10-to-20
TIMES over in the next couple years.

See why I call it ""Why the heck not?""  Just a tiny
amount of risk capital can turn into a really nice
chunk of change.

Frankly, my worst expectations are for a NEAR-TERM
DOUBLE.  That happens and you can even sell half your
position, keep half -- and have none of your original
investment at risk.  Everything after that is gravy!

THAT'S THE BIOTECH GAME, my friend.  It's one of the
few ways left for the average guy to get stinking
rich.  So if you've got a little cash to spare -- and
have a love for tape-measure home runs -- you've got
to check this stock out.

Here's the story.

Gene sequencing and human cloning get all the
headlines, but a lot of the most compelling work in
biotech comes from much more ""boring"" fields.  This
little company -- for example -- is doing AMAZING
STUFF with common carbohydrate compounds.  In fact,
its experimental drug GBC-590 may prove to be one of
the biggest success stories of the decade.

LET ME STRESS the word ""experimental.""  It's not
approved yet -- it's still going through clinical
trials.  That's why the stock price is so low...but
that's also why you have a chance to multiply your
investment twenty fold -- if you get in now!

This drug may be experimental, but it's also on the
FAST-TRACK towards FDA-approval.  Management stepped
up the pace of clinical studies after initial results
proved very favorable.

In fact, Phase 1 results -- primarily used to show the
safety of a drug -- showed REMARKABLE BENEFITS against
prostate cancer.  It stabilized or reduced PSA
(prostate specific antigen) levels in 80% of the
patients, with advanced cancer, tested!  High PSAs, of
course, are a marker of prostate cancer -- and a sign
that the disease is spreading uncontrollably.

Today, there is no effective treatment that improves
the survival rates for men whose cancer continues to
spread -- even after surgery.  That's why this news is
so important.  It means new hope for patients who
thought they had none.

AND FOR INVESTORS like us, it means wealth potentially
beyond our wildest dreams.

Remember, clinical trials are still ongoing.  But GBC-
590 seems to work by attaching itself to receptor
points on individual cells, much like the space
shuttle docks at the orbiting space station.  Once
""locked in,"" this drug thwarts the typical metastatic
action -- that is, it stops the cancer from spreading!

Imagine the wealth-building potential!  But the story
doesn't stop there.

Animal-modeling with GBC-590 suggests a possible
BREAKTHROUGH in the treatment of pancreatic cancer,
which typically has a five-year death rate of 99%!
43% of mice survived past the 43-day benchmark versus
none given the most-commonly used drug for pancreatic
cancer.  And 33% of the GBC-590 mice were 100% CURED
of their tumors!

Phase II trials on human pancreatic and colorectal
cancer patients are now underway.  And any positive
news here should send this stock skyrocketing.

WHAT'S MORE, this biotech is not some one-trick pony.
One of its more interesting developments is CAN-296, a
new breakthrough against drug-resistant fungus,
including Aspergillus and Candida.  Pre-clinical
studies suggest it's very effective and extremely
fast-acting.  Icing on the cake!

I won't claim that everyone should own this stock.
It's an aggressive play, and no one should put a lot
of money in it.

But then again, you don't need a lot.  Just a small
investment now could well mushroom into a not-so-small
FORTUNE over the next several years.  I think it's
worth a look -- and a few thousand dollars, as well.

TRY A RISK-FREE trial subscription to my Forecasts &
Strategies advisory and I'll give you this company's
name NOW -- immediately, online.  You'll also get a
Special Introductory Report detailing all my top
current recommendations.

And trust me, they're not all biotech.  I've got a
host of stocks, funds, income vehicles and more that
are all TOP-NOTCH investments for times like these.

Best of all, when I say a ""risk-free subscription,"" I
mean it.  Try Forecasts & Strategies for six full
months and see if I'm blowing smoke or making you
money.  If you don't like F&S -- if you're not getting
richer -- just say, ""No thanks,"" and your subscription
doesn't cost you a dime.

That's an ironclad 6-month guarantee of total 100%
satisfaction.  So try Forecast & Strategies to see for
yourself the advantages I bring.  Go here now:

Sincerely,
Mark Skousen, Ph. D.
Forecasts & Strategies

P.S.  I think this stock will make party chatter a lot
of fun.  Invest a thousand bucks and you could make
enough to buy a new car.  ""Why the heck not?""  Click

Natural Gas Futures Dip Lower in Quiet Trading

    Natural gas for March delivery on the NYMEX dropped $0.043 to $2.074
per MMBtu yesterday. The April contract lost $0.032 to $2.152 per MMBtu.
The market dipped lower soon after opening higher and spent most of the
session between $2.10 - $2.12, but fell off sharply near the close as
locals sold down the contract to the $2.07 support level and went home
short. The AGA will release this week's storage report this afternoon, and
while some traders are predicting a very bearish less than 100 Bcf
withdrawal, look for the number to be closer to 120 Bcf. Cold weather in
the Midwest and Texas, the growing differential between cash and futures,
and the perceived premium in the early March contract have kept the market
from dropping further. Physical prices retained their premium over futures
yesterday on short-term cold weather at some pipelines, maintaining about
a $0.07 - $0.10 premium over the NYMEX. But cash traders expect the demand
to ease quickly as temperatures moderate by this weekend. As usual, the
market will look to the weekly storage report for short term direction,
but it is the massive amount of volumes still in storage compared to last
year that has put a cap on longer term price increases. Natural gas for
next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally flat to plus or
minus a few cents yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the
Henry hub gained $0.02 to $2.20 per MMBtu.

Enron Executives Knew of Losses


    Enron's top executives and board of directors knew as early as March
that its off the books partnerships were losing money, according to
William Powers, dean of the University of Texas Law School who was
appointed Enron's board of directors to investigate the company. In
testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Powers said that
Enron had a $500 million loss in March. Rather than report it to
shareholders, Enron gave a partnership called Raptor another $800 million
in Enron shares. He said that there is no doubt that almost everyone, from
the board of directors on down, knew that the company was attempting to
offset investment losses with stock. The partnerships allowed Enron to
misrepresent earnings for a period spanning the 3rd quarter of 2000
through the 3rd quarter of 2001 by $1 billion. Powers told that committee
that over 70% of Enron's earnings for that period were false. He said that
there were red flags that should have alerted former chairman Ken Lay to
what was happening. Powers says that Lay definitely understood that Enron
was using its own stock to offset the losses in the partnerships.
