As it increases, the Spread decreases.\n\t- In a running market, the offset will increase quickly. If it establishes a new level, the Offset will slowly decrease\n\t- If the market runs up and whipsaws back, the offset will stay large\n\t- If a market range trades, the offset will trend to zero.\n\t- If there are a large number of transaction in succession, the spread will widen\n\t- If there are a small number of transactions in succession, the spread will tighten.\n\n \n\nDave\n\n\t"}, "full_op_id": "0d9c20c90c-1d7551c05a", "logical_op_id": "0d9c20c90c", "op_name": "MarshalAndScanDataOp", "time_per_record": 0.000537872314453125, "cost_per_record": 0.0, "source_unique_full_op_ids": null, "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "94e693191e", "quality": 1.0, "model_name": null, "answer": null, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 0.0, "total_output_tokens": 0.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0, "total_output_cost": 0.0, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": null, "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": true, "llm_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 0, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"datasource_id": "emails"}}, {"record_id": "ad320b5a9f", "record_parent_ids": null, "record_source_indices": ["emails-10"], "record_state": {"filename": "arnold-j-inbox-166.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <14163285.1075861676333.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 27 Nov 2001 10:25:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: kbusch@energyargus.com\nTo: john.arnold@enron.com\nSubject: keeping the lights on\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: \"Kelly Busch\" <kbusch@energyargus.com>@ENRON\nX-To: Arnold, John </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JARNOLD>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\JARNOLD (Non-Privileged)\\Arnold, John\\Inbox\nX-Origin: Arnold-J\nX-FileName: JARNOLD (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n\nJohn-\nWas lovely meeting  you this weekend.

We really do but have been holed up trying to complete\nthis project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we\nfound that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our\nusers back on-line.\n\nWe have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked\nyour additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This\nprocess was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100\nIBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and\nconfidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying\ndata and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of\nyou (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than\nonce or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want\ndisplayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or\nphone) the information to us and we will remove this information right\naway.\n\nTo our IBS Billpayer clients:\n\nDuring this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill\npayment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring\npayments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our\nhighest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the\nprocess of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this\ninformation. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the\nmonths of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence\n(and support).\n\nAgain, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and\nourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be\none of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account\ninformation, please refer to the following information:\n\n1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was\nthe correct password) and been given the error message \"You have failed\nto correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or\ncontact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset.\" This is\nthe easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you\nonline (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you\nreceive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for\neither myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @\n830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail\n(or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back\n#.\n\n2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the\nssn# or tin# of the primary account holder).

This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =\nof the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=\ns of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=\nceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=\n of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=\n of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=\nrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=\ns a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=\nock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=\nres in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=\nn several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=\nat the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=\nf Enron Corp. common stock.\n\nThere are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=\n  section 6.3 begins with \"notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=\n\"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=\nctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=\nt apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating \"a single sum distrib=\nution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts\" indicates that one pay=\nment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.\n\nThe interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =\nis the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=\nhe Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states \"The val=\nue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=\ng price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=\nment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock\".=\n  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=\n share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =\nbeneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=\np. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=\nction 6.3.\n\nThe calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=\n distribution under each of the three interpretations:\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1\n\nNumber of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=\nes\nRelative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13\nPhantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658\n10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866\nValue to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792\nCurrent stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10\nDistribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares\n\nI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =\nadministrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=\n.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =\na hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. =\n =20\n\nIn addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=\n same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt=\ner.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nPhillip Allen   =20\n=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09"}, "full_op_id": "0d9c20c90c-1d7551c05a", "logical_op_id": "0d9c20c90c", "op_name": "MarshalAndScanDataOp", "time_per_record": 0.0008609294891357422, "cost_per_record": 0.0, "source_unique_full_op_ids": null, "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "94e693191e", "quality": 1.0, "model_name": null, "answer": null, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 0.0, "total_output_tokens": 0.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0, "total_output_cost": 0.0, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": null, "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": true, "llm_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 0, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"datasource_id": "emails"}}, {"record_id": "db097d02ed", "record_parent_ids": null, "record_source_indices": ["emails-0"], "record_state": {"filename": "allen-p-inbox-42.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <8268911.1075858645425.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 29 Oct 2001 18:08:10 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: mondohed@gte.net\nTo: pallen@ect.enron.com\nSubject: Fw: Golfin' and Wedding!!!\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: \"Armando Martinez\" <mondohed@gte.net>@ENRON\nX-To: Phillip K Allen <pallen@ect.enron.com>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\PALLEN (Non-Privileged)\\Allen, Phillip K.\\Inbox\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: PALLEN (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n\n \n----- Original Message -----  \nFrom: Stephen  Bilby  \nTo: Alfred E Newman (E-mail)  ; Army (E-mail)  ; Armando Martinez (E-mail)  ;  Bryan Lilley  (E-mail)  ; Craig Carter (E-mail)  ; E.

As it increases, the Spread decreases.\n\t- In a running market, the offset will increase quickly. If it establishes a new level, the Offset will slowly decrease\n\t- If the market runs up and whipsaws back, the offset will stay large\n\t- If a market range trades, the offset will trend to zero.\n\t- If there are a large number of transaction in succession, the spread will widen\n\t- If there are a small number of transactions in succession, the spread will tighten.\n\n \n\nDave\n\n\t"}, "full_op_id": "c68450884a-05479fb16c", "logical_op_id": "c68450884a", "op_name": "CritiqueAndRefineFilter", "time_per_record": 12.985031127929688, "cost_per_record": 0.0084604, "source_unique_full_op_ids": null, "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "94e693191e", "quality": 1.0, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": {"passed_operator": false}, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 4528.0, "total_output_tokens": 357.0, "total_input_cost": 0.007607000000000001, "total_output_cost": 0.0008534, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": "The content mentions tee times", "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": false, "llm_call_duration_secs": 12.981281757354736, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 3, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"critic_model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "refine_model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "prompt_strategy": "filter", "reasoning_effort": "None", "filter": "The content mentions tee times", "desc": "None"}}, {"record_id": "22c7d0bd0a", "record_parent_ids": ["ad320b5a9f"], "record_source_indices": ["emails-10"], "record_state": {"filename": "arnold-j-inbox-166.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <14163285.1075861676333.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 27 Nov 2001 10:25:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: kbusch@energyargus.com\nTo: john.arnold@enron.com\nSubject: keeping the lights on\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: \"Kelly Busch\" <kbusch@energyargus.com>@ENRON\nX-To: Arnold, John </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JARNOLD>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\JARNOLD (Non-Privileged)\\Arnold, John\\Inbox\nX-Origin: Arnold-J\nX-FileName: JARNOLD (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n\nJohn-\nWas lovely meeting  you this weekend.

We really do but have been holed up trying to complete\nthis project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we\nfound that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our\nusers back on-line.\n\nWe have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked\nyour additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This\nprocess was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100\nIBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and\nconfidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying\ndata and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of\nyou (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than\nonce or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want\ndisplayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or\nphone) the information to us and we will remove this information right\naway.\n\nTo our IBS Billpayer clients:\n\nDuring this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill\npayment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring\npayments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our\nhighest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the\nprocess of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this\ninformation. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the\nmonths of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence\n(and support).\n\nAgain, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and\nourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be\none of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account\ninformation, please refer to the following information:\n\n1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was\nthe correct password) and been given the error message \"You have failed\nto correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or\ncontact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset.\" This is\nthe easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you\nonline (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you\nreceive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for\neither myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @\n830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail\n(or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back\n#.\n\n2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the\nssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the\nlast six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the\nprimary account holder. Since we have released these accounts for IBS\naccess, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn#\n(this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will\nbe directed to a screen that asks for information such as:\n\nName\nAddress\nCity, State Zip+4\nPhone #\nE-Mail Address\n\nAfter entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be\ninstructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can\nat this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always\nremember that your password is case sensitive.\n\nAgain we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying)\nordeal, and we look forward to serving your IBS needs in the future.\n\nSincerely,\n\nHoward Gordon\nNetwork Manager\n\n - geninfo.vcf "}, "full_op_id": "c68450884a-05479fb16c", "logical_op_id": "c68450884a", "op_name": "CritiqueAndRefineFilter", "time_per_record": 11.467241048812866, "cost_per_record": 0.01082375, "source_unique_full_op_ids": null, "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "94e693191e", "quality": 1.0, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": {"passed_operator": false}, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 5151.0, "total_output_tokens": 482.0, "total_input_cost": 0.00888015, "total_output_cost": 0.0019436000000000002, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": "The content mentions tee times", "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": false, "llm_call_duration_secs": 11.462371587753296, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 3, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"critic_model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "refine_model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "prompt_strategy": "filter", "reasoning_effort": "None", "filter": "The content mentions tee times", "desc": "None"}}, {"record_id": "10ea547bdf", "record_parent_ids": ["404b22cfff"], "record_source_indices": ["emails-18"], "record_state": {"filename": "arnold-j-inbox-96.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <4724114.1075855217865.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 31 Dec 2001 13:20:07 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: customerservice@qwikfliks.com\nTo: john.arnold@enron.com\nSubject: L.A.

This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =\nof the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=\ns of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=\nceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=\n of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=\n of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=\nrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=\ns a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=\nock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=\nres in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=\nn several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=\nat the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=\nf Enron Corp. common stock.\n\nThere are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=\n  section 6.3 begins with \"notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=\n\"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=\nctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=\nt apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating \"a single sum distrib=\nution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts\" indicates that one pay=\nment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.\n\nThe interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =\nis the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=\nhe Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states \"The val=\nue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=\ng price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=\nment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock\".=\n  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=\n share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =\nbeneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=\np. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=\nction 6.3.\n\nThe calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=\n distribution under each of the three interpretations:\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1\n\nNumber of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=\nes\nRelative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13\nPhantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658\n10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866\nValue to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792\nCurrent stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10\nDistribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares\n\nI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.

As it increases, the Spread decreases.\n\t- In a running market, the offset will increase quickly. If it establishes a new level, the Offset will slowly decrease\n\t- If the market runs up and whipsaws back, the offset will stay large\n\t- If a market range trades, the offset will trend to zero.\n\t- If there are a large number of transaction in succession, the spread will widen\n\t- If there are a small number of transactions in succession, the spread will tighten.\n\n \n\nDave\n\n\t"}, "full_op_id": "c68450884a-0a89f63d5b", "logical_op_id": "c68450884a", "op_name": "MixtureOfAgentsFilter", "time_per_record": 5.460787057876587, "cost_per_record": 0.0069525, "source_unique_full_op_ids": null, "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "94e693191e", "quality": 1.0, "model_name": null, "answer": {"passed_operator": false}, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 2097.0, "total_output_tokens": 171.0, "total_input_cost": 0.005242500000000001, "total_output_cost": 0.0017100000000000001, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": "The content mentions tee times", "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": false, "llm_call_duration_secs": 5.458277940750122, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 2, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"proposer_models": "['openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06']", "temperatures": "[0.8]", "aggregator_model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "model": "None", "prompt_strategy": "None", "reasoning_effort": "None", "filter": "The content mentions tee times", "desc": "None"}}, {"record_id": "22c7d0bd0a", "record_parent_ids": ["ad320b5a9f"], "record_source_indices": ["emails-10"], "record_state": {"filename": "arnold-j-inbox-166.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <14163285.1075861676333.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 27 Nov 2001 10:25:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: kbusch@energyargus.com\nTo: john.arnold@enron.com\nSubject: keeping the lights on\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: \"Kelly Busch\" <kbusch@energyargus.com>@ENRON\nX-To: Arnold, John </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JARNOLD>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\JARNOLD (Non-Privileged)\\Arnold, John\\Inbox\nX-Origin: Arnold-J\nX-FileName: JARNOLD (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n\nJohn-\nWas lovely meeting  you this weekend.

We really do but have been holed up trying to complete\nthis project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we\nfound that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our\nusers back on-line.\n\nWe have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked\nyour additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This\nprocess was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100\nIBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and\nconfidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying\ndata and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of\nyou (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than\nonce or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want\ndisplayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or\nphone) the information to us and we will remove this information right\naway.\n\nTo our IBS Billpayer clients:\n\nDuring this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill\npayment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring\npayments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our\nhighest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the\nprocess of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this\ninformation. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the\nmonths of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence\n(and support).\n\nAgain, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and\nourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be\none of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account\ninformation, please refer to the following information:\n\n1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was\nthe correct password) and been given the error message \"You have failed\nto correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or\ncontact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset.\" This is\nthe easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you\nonline (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you\nreceive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for\neither myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @\n830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail\n(or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back\n#.\n\n2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the\nssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the\nlast six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the\nprimary account holder. Since we have released these accounts for IBS\naccess, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn#\n(this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will\nbe directed to a screen that asks for information such as:\n\nName\nAddress\nCity, State Zip+4\nPhone #\nE-Mail Address\n\nAfter entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be\ninstructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can\nat this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always\nremember that your password is case sensitive.\n\nAgain we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying)\nordeal, and we look forward to serving your IBS needs in the future.\n\nSincerely,\n\nHoward Gordon\nNetwork Manager\n\n - geninfo.vcf "}, "full_op_id": "c68450884a-0a89f63d5b", "logical_op_id": "c68450884a", "op_name": "MixtureOfAgentsFilter", "time_per_record": 4.059620141983032, "cost_per_record": 0.006320000000000001, "source_unique_full_op_ids": null, "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "94e693191e", "quality": 1.0, "model_name": null, "answer": {"passed_operator": false}, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 2136.0, "total_output_tokens": 98.0, "total_input_cost": 0.005340000000000001, "total_output_cost": 0.0009800000000000002, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": "The content mentions tee times", "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": false, "llm_call_duration_secs": 4.056814193725586, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 2, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"proposer_models": "['openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06']", "temperatures": "[0.8]", "aggregator_model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "model": "None", "prompt_strategy": "None", "reasoning_effort": "None", "filter": "The content mentions tee times", "desc": "None"}}, {"record_id": "10ea547bdf", "record_parent_ids": ["404b22cfff"], "record_source_indices": ["emails-18"], "record_state": {"filename": "arnold-j-inbox-96.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <4724114.1075855217865.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 31 Dec 2001 13:20:07 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: customerservice@qwikfliks.com\nTo: john.arnold@enron.com\nSubject: L.A.

This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =\nof the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=\ns of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=\nceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=\n of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=\n of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=\nrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=\ns a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=\nock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=\nres in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=\nn several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=\nat the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=\nf Enron Corp. common stock.\n\nThere are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=\n  section 6.3 begins with \"notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=\n\"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=\nctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=\nt apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating \"a single sum distrib=\nution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts\" indicates that one pay=\nment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.\n\nThe interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =\nis the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=\nhe Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states \"The val=\nue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=\ng price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=\nment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock\".=\n  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=\n share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =\nbeneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=\np. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=\nction 6.3.\n\nThe calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=\n distribution under each of the three interpretations:\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1\n\nNumber of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=\nes\nRelative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13\nPhantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658\n10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866\nValue to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792\nCurrent stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10\nDistribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares\n\nI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.

As it increases, the Spread decreases.\n\t- In a running market, the offset will increase quickly. If it establishes a new level, the Offset will slowly decrease\n\t- If the market runs up and whipsaws back, the offset will stay large\n\t- If a market range trades, the offset will trend to zero.\n\t- If there are a large number of transaction in succession, the spread will widen\n\t- If there are a small number of transactions in succession, the spread will tighten.\n\n \n\nDave\n\n\t"}, "full_op_id": "c68450884a-37c9317b27", "logical_op_id": "c68450884a", "op_name": "CritiqueAndRefineFilter", "time_per_record": 10.195716857910156, "cost_per_record": 0.00577695, "source_unique_full_op_ids": null, "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "94e693191e", "quality": 1.0, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "answer": {"passed_operator": false}, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 4739.0, "total_output_tokens": 383.0, "total_input_cost": 0.005001950000000001, "total_output_cost": 0.000775, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": "The content mentions tee times", "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": false, "llm_call_duration_secs": 10.189759731292725, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 3, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"critic_model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "refine_model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "prompt_strategy": "filter", "reasoning_effort": "None", "filter": "The content mentions tee times", "desc": "None"}}, {"record_id": "22c7d0bd0a", "record_parent_ids": ["ad320b5a9f"], "record_source_indices": ["emails-10"], "record_state": {"filename": "arnold-j-inbox-166.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <14163285.1075861676333.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 27 Nov 2001 10:25:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: kbusch@energyargus.com\nTo: john.arnold@enron.com\nSubject: keeping the lights on\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: \"Kelly Busch\" <kbusch@energyargus.com>@ENRON\nX-To: Arnold, John </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JARNOLD>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\JARNOLD (Non-Privileged)\\Arnold, John\\Inbox\nX-Origin: Arnold-J\nX-FileName: JARNOLD (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n\nJohn-\nWas lovely meeting  you this weekend.

We really do but have been holed up trying to complete\nthis project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we\nfound that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our\nusers back on-line.\n\nWe have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked\nyour additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This\nprocess was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100\nIBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and\nconfidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying\ndata and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of\nyou (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than\nonce or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want\ndisplayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or\nphone) the information to us and we will remove this information right\naway.\n\nTo our IBS Billpayer clients:\n\nDuring this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill\npayment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring\npayments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our\nhighest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the\nprocess of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this\ninformation. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the\nmonths of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence\n(and support).\n\nAgain, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and\nourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be\none of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account\ninformation, please refer to the following information:\n\n1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was\nthe correct password) and been given the error message \"You have failed\nto correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or\ncontact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset.\" This is\nthe easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you\nonline (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you\nreceive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for\neither myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @\n830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail\n(or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back\n#.\n\n2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the\nssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the\nlast six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the\nprimary account holder. Since we have released these accounts for IBS\naccess, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn#\n(this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will\nbe directed to a screen that asks for information such as:\n\nName\nAddress\nCity, State Zip+4\nPhone #\nE-Mail Address\n\nAfter entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be\ninstructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can\nat this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always\nremember that your password is case sensitive.\n\nAgain we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying)\nordeal, and we look forward to serving your IBS needs in the future.\n\nSincerely,\n\nHoward Gordon\nNetwork Manager\n\n - geninfo.vcf "}, "full_op_id": "c68450884a-37c9317b27", "logical_op_id": "c68450884a", "op_name": "CritiqueAndRefineFilter", "time_per_record": 10.4966881275177, "cost_per_record": 0.0062803500000000005, "source_unique_full_op_ids": null, "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "94e693191e", "quality": 1.0, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "answer": {"passed_operator": false}, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 5016.0, "total_output_tokens": 389.0, "total_input_cost": 0.00522915, "total_output_cost": 0.0010512000000000002, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": "The content mentions tee times", "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": false, "llm_call_duration_secs": 10.484827756881714, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 3, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"critic_model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "refine_model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "prompt_strategy": "filter", "reasoning_effort": "None", "filter": "The content mentions tee times", "desc": "None"}}, {"record_id": "10ea547bdf", "record_parent_ids": ["404b22cfff"], "record_source_indices": ["emails-18"], "record_state": {"filename": "arnold-j-inbox-96.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <4724114.1075855217865.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 31 Dec 2001 13:20:07 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: customerservice@qwikfliks.com\nTo: john.arnold@enron.com\nSubject: L.A.

This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =\nof the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=\ns of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=\nceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=\n of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=\n of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=\nrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=\ns a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=\nock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=\nres in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=\nn several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=\nat the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=\nf Enron Corp. common stock.\n\nThere are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=\n  section 6.3 begins with \"notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=\n\"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=\nctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=\nt apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating \"a single sum distrib=\nution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts\" indicates that one pay=\nment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.\n\nThe interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =\nis the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=\nhe Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states \"The val=\nue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=\ng price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=\nment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock\".=\n  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=\n share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =\nbeneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=\np. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=\nction 6.3.\n\nThe calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=\n distribution under each of the three interpretations:\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1\n\nNumber of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=\nes\nRelative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13\nPhantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658\n10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866\nValue to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792\nCurrent stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10\nDistribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares\n\nI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =\nadministrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=\n.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =\na hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. =\n =20\n\nIn addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=\n same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt=\ner.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nPhillip Allen   =20\n=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09"}, "full_op_id": "c68450884a-37c9317b27", "logical_op_id": "c68450884a", "op_name": "CritiqueAndRefineFilter", "time_per_record": 8.814882040023804, "cost_per_record": 0.0068775, "source_unique_full_op_ids": null, "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "94e693191e", "quality": 1.0, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "answer": {"passed_operator": false}, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 5945.0, "total_output_tokens": 400.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0061675, "total_output_cost": 0.00071, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": "The content mentions tee times", "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": false, "llm_call_duration_secs": 8.807897806167603, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 3, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"critic_model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "refine_model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "prompt_strategy": "filter", "reasoning_effort": "None", "filter": "The content mentions tee times", "desc": "None"}}, {"record_id": "2105e999c6", "record_parent_ids": ["db097d02ed"], "record_source_indices": ["emails-0"], "record_state": {"filename": "allen-p-inbox-42.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <8268911.1075858645425.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 29 Oct 2001 18:08:10 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: mondohed@gte.net\nTo: pallen@ect.enron.com\nSubject: Fw: Golfin' and Wedding!!!\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: \"Armando Martinez\" <mondohed@gte.net>@ENRON\nX-To: Phillip K Allen <pallen@ect.enron.com>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\PALLEN (Non-Privileged)\\Allen, Phillip K.\\Inbox\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: PALLEN (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n\n \n----- Original Message -----  \nFrom: Stephen  Bilby  \nTo: Alfred E Newman (E-mail)  ; Army (E-mail)  ; Armando Martinez (E-mail)  ;  Bryan Lilley  (E-mail)  ; Craig Carter (E-mail)  ; E.

This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  \n\n      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.\n"}, "full_op_id": "c68450884a-37c9317b27", "logical_op_id": "c68450884a", "op_name": "CritiqueAndRefineFilter", "time_per_record": 9.09085202217102, "cost_per_record": 0.0046496, "source_unique_full_op_ids": null, "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "94e693191e", "quality": 1.0, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "answer": {"passed_operator": false}, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 3530.0, "total_output_tokens": 373.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0038524, "total_output_cost": 0.0007972000000000001, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": "The content mentions tee times", "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": false, "llm_call_duration_secs": 9.081876993179321, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 3, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"critic_model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "refine_model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "prompt_strategy": "filter", "reasoning_effort": "None", "filter": "The content mentions tee times", "desc": "None"}}, {"record_id": "e9794b7631", "record_parent_ids": ["9b3347cfc7"], "record_source_indices": ["emails-11"], "record_state": {"filename": "arnold-j-inbox-174.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <27701631.1075861676607.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 27 Nov 2001 15:35:55 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: houston <.ward@enron.com>\nTo: john.arnold@enron.com\nSubject: RE:\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Ward, Kim S (Houston) </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=KWARD>\nX-To: Arnold, John </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jarnold>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\JARNOLD (Non-Privileged)\\Arnold, John\\Inbox\nX-Origin: Arnold-J\nX-FileName: JARNOLD (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nyou still here?\n \n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Arnold, John \nSent: Monday, November 26, 2001 6:17 PM\nTo: Ward, Kim S (Houston)\nSubject: RE:\n\n\ngood try at the lingo but an inappropriate usage due to the fact monday morning is when YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WORK OUT.\n\n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Ward, Kim S (Houston) \nSent: Mon 11/26/2001 4:01 PM \nTo: Arnold, John \nCc: \nSubject: RE: \n\n\n\nthanks for the look \n\n\n -----Original Message----- \nFrom:   Arnold, John  \nSent:   Monday, November 26, 2001 2:05 PM \nTo:     Ward, Kim S (Houston) \nSubject:        RE: \n\nI went already lazy \n\n -----Original Message----- \nFrom:   Ward, Kim S (Houston)  \nSent:   Monday, November 26, 2001 1:48 PM \nTo:     Arnold, John \nSubject:        \n\nDid you go this morning?

As it increases, the Spread decreases.\n\t- In a running market, the offset will increase quickly. If it establishes a new level, the Offset will slowly decrease\n\t- If the market runs up and whipsaws back, the offset will stay large\n\t- If a market range trades, the offset will trend to zero.\n\t- If there are a large number of transaction in succession, the spread will widen\n\t- If there are a small number of transactions in succession, the spread will tighten.\n\n \n\nDave\n\n\t"}, "full_op_id": "c68450884a-6def9991f4", "logical_op_id": "c68450884a", "op_name": "MixtureOfAgentsFilter", "time_per_record": 5.597827196121216, "cost_per_record": 0.007177500000000001, "source_unique_full_op_ids": null, "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "94e693191e", "quality": 1.0, "model_name": null, "answer": {"passed_operator": false}, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 2123.0, "total_output_tokens": 187.0, "total_input_cost": 0.005307500000000001, "total_output_cost": 0.0018700000000000001, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": "The content mentions tee times", "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": false, "llm_call_duration_secs": 5.596178770065308, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 2, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"proposer_models": "['openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06']", "temperatures": "[0.0]", "aggregator_model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "model": "None", "prompt_strategy": "None", "reasoning_effort": "None", "filter": "The content mentions tee times", "desc": "None"}}, {"record_id": "22c7d0bd0a", "record_parent_ids": ["ad320b5a9f"], "record_source_indices": ["emails-10"], "record_state": {"filename": "arnold-j-inbox-166.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <14163285.1075861676333.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 27 Nov 2001 10:25:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: kbusch@energyargus.com\nTo: john.arnold@enron.com\nSubject: keeping the lights on\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: \"Kelly Busch\" <kbusch@energyargus.com>@ENRON\nX-To: Arnold, John </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JARNOLD>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\JARNOLD (Non-Privileged)\\Arnold, John\\Inbox\nX-Origin: Arnold-J\nX-FileName: JARNOLD (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n\nJohn-\nWas lovely meeting  you this weekend.

We really do but have been holed up trying to complete\nthis project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we\nfound that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our\nusers back on-line.\n\nWe have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked\nyour additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This\nprocess was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100\nIBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and\nconfidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying\ndata and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of\nyou (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than\nonce or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want\ndisplayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or\nphone) the information to us and we will remove this information right\naway.\n\nTo our IBS Billpayer clients:\n\nDuring this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill\npayment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring\npayments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our\nhighest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the\nprocess of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this\ninformation. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the\nmonths of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence\n(and support).\n\nAgain, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and\nourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be\none of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account\ninformation, please refer to the following information:\n\n1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was\nthe correct password) and been given the error message \"You have failed\nto correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or\ncontact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset.\" This is\nthe easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you\nonline (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you\nreceive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for\neither myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @\n830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail\n(or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back\n#.\n\n2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the\nssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the\nlast six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the\nprimary account holder. Since we have released these accounts for IBS\naccess, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn#\n(this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will\nbe directed to a screen that asks for information such as:\n\nName\nAddress\nCity, State Zip+4\nPhone #\nE-Mail Address\n\nAfter entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be\ninstructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can\nat this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always\nremember that your password is case sensitive.\n\nAgain we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying)\nordeal, and we look forward to serving your IBS needs in the future.\n\nSincerely,\n\nHoward Gordon\nNetwork Manager\n\n - geninfo.vcf "}, "full_op_id": "c68450884a-6def9991f4", "logical_op_id": "c68450884a", "op_name": "MixtureOfAgentsFilter", "time_per_record": 4.188805103302002, "cost_per_record": 0.0065775, "source_unique_full_op_ids": null, "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "94e693191e", "quality": 1.0, "model_name": null, "answer": {"passed_operator": false}, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 2115.0, "total_output_tokens": 129.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0052875000000000005, "total_output_cost": 0.0012900000000000001, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": "The content mentions tee times", "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": false, "llm_call_duration_secs": 4.18652606010437, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 2, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"proposer_models": "['openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06']", "temperatures": "[0.0]", "aggregator_model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "model": "None", "prompt_strategy": "None", "reasoning_effort": "None", "filter": "The content mentions tee times", "desc": "None"}}, {"record_id": "10ea547bdf", "record_parent_ids": ["404b22cfff"], "record_source_indices": ["emails-18"], "record_state": {"filename": "arnold-j-inbox-96.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <4724114.1075855217865.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 31 Dec 2001 13:20:07 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: customerservice@qwikfliks.com\nTo: john.arnold@enron.com\nSubject: L.A.

This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =\nof the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=\ns of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=\nceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=\n of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=\n of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=\nrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=\ns a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=\nock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=\nres in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=\nn several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=\nat the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=\nf Enron Corp. common stock.\n\nThere are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=\n  section 6.3 begins with \"notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=\n\"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=\nctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=\nt apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating \"a single sum distrib=\nution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts\" indicates that one pay=\nment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.\n\nThe interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =\nis the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=\nhe Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states \"The val=\nue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=\ng price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=\nment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock\".=\n  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=\n share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =\nbeneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=\np. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=\nction 6.3.\n\nThe calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=\n distribution under each of the three interpretations:\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1\n\nNumber of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=\nes\nRelative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13\nPhantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658\n10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866\nValue to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792\nCurrent stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10\nDistribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares\n\nI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.

As it increases, the Spread decreases.\n\t- In a running market, the offset will increase quickly. If it establishes a new level, the Offset will slowly decrease\n\t- If the market runs up and whipsaws back, the offset will stay large\n\t- If a market range trades, the offset will trend to zero.\n\t- If there are a large number of transaction in succession, the spread will widen\n\t- If there are a small number of transactions in succession, the spread will tighten.\n\n \n\nDave\n\n\t"}, "full_op_id": "c68450884a-777e016922", "logical_op_id": "c68450884a", "op_name": "CritiqueAndRefineFilter", "time_per_record": 10.715277194976807, "cost_per_record": 0.0165875, "source_unique_full_op_ids": null, "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "94e693191e", "quality": 1.0, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": {"passed_operator": false}, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 4819.0, "total_output_tokens": 454.0, "total_input_cost": 0.012047500000000001, "total_output_cost": 0.004540000000000001, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": "The content mentions tee times", "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": false, "llm_call_duration_secs": 10.70906400680542, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 3, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"critic_model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "refine_model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "prompt_strategy": "filter", "reasoning_effort": "None", "filter": "The content mentions tee times", "desc": "None"}}, {"record_id": "22c7d0bd0a", "record_parent_ids": ["ad320b5a9f"], "record_source_indices": ["emails-10"], "record_state": {"filename": "arnold-j-inbox-166.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <14163285.1075861676333.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 27 Nov 2001 10:25:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: kbusch@energyargus.com\nTo: john.arnold@enron.com\nSubject: keeping the lights on\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: \"Kelly Busch\" <kbusch@energyargus.com>@ENRON\nX-To: Arnold, John </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JARNOLD>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\JARNOLD (Non-Privileged)\\Arnold, John\\Inbox\nX-Origin: Arnold-J\nX-FileName: JARNOLD (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n\nJohn-\nWas lovely meeting  you this weekend.

We really do but have been holed up trying to complete\nthis project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we\nfound that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our\nusers back on-line.\n\nWe have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked\nyour additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This\nprocess was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100\nIBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and\nconfidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying\ndata and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of\nyou (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than\nonce or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want\ndisplayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or\nphone) the information to us and we will remove this information right\naway.\n\nTo our IBS Billpayer clients:\n\nDuring this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill\npayment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring\npayments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our\nhighest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the\nprocess of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this\ninformation. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the\nmonths of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence\n(and support).\n\nAgain, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and\nourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be\none of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account\ninformation, please refer to the following information:\n\n1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was\nthe correct password) and been given the error message \"You have failed\nto correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or\ncontact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset.\" This is\nthe easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you\nonline (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you\nreceive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for\neither myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @\n830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail\n(or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back\n#.\n\n2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the\nssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the\nlast six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the\nprimary account holder. Since we have released these accounts for IBS\naccess, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn#\n(this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will\nbe directed to a screen that asks for information such as:\n\nName\nAddress\nCity, State Zip+4\nPhone #\nE-Mail Address\n\nAfter entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be\ninstructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can\nat this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always\nremember that your password is case sensitive.\n\nAgain we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying)\nordeal, and we look forward to serving your IBS needs in the future.\n\nSincerely,\n\nHoward Gordon\nNetwork Manager\n\n - geninfo.vcf "}, "full_op_id": "c68450884a-777e016922", "logical_op_id": "c68450884a", "op_name": "CritiqueAndRefineFilter", "time_per_record": 10.28957486152649, "cost_per_record": 0.015830000000000004, "source_unique_full_op_ids": null, "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "94e693191e", "quality": 1.0, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": {"passed_operator": false}, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 4864.0, "total_output_tokens": 367.0, "total_input_cost": 0.01216, "total_output_cost": 0.00367, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": "The content mentions tee times", "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": false, "llm_call_duration_secs": 10.28531789779663, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 3, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"critic_model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "refine_model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "prompt_strategy": "filter", "reasoning_effort": "None", "filter": "The content mentions tee times", "desc": "None"}}, {"record_id": "10ea547bdf", "record_parent_ids": ["404b22cfff"], "record_source_indices": ["emails-18"], "record_state": {"filename": "arnold-j-inbox-96.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <4724114.1075855217865.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 31 Dec 2001 13:20:07 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: customerservice@qwikfliks.com\nTo: john.arnold@enron.com\nSubject: L.A.

This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =\nof the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=\ns of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=\nceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=\n of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=\n of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=\nrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=\ns a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=\nock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=\nres in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=\nn several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=\nat the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=\nf Enron Corp. common stock.\n\nThere are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=\n  section 6.3 begins with \"notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=\n\"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=\nctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=\nt apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating \"a single sum distrib=\nution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts\" indicates that one pay=\nment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.\n\nThe interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =\nis the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=\nhe Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states \"The val=\nue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=\ng price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=\nment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock\".=\n  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=\n share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =\nbeneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=\np. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=\nction 6.3.\n\nThe calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=\n distribution under each of the three interpretations:\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1\n\nNumber of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=\nes\nRelative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13\nPhantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658\n10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866\nValue to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792\nCurrent stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10\nDistribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares\n\nI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.

As it increases, the Spread decreases.\n\t- In a running market, the offset will increase quickly. If it establishes a new level, the Offset will slowly decrease\n\t- If the market runs up and whipsaws back, the offset will stay large\n\t- If a market range trades, the offset will trend to zero.\n\t- If there are a large number of transaction in succession, the spread will widen\n\t- If there are a small number of transactions in succession, the spread will tighten.\n\n \n\nDave\n\n\t"}, "full_op_id": "c68450884a-80d457d66d", "logical_op_id": "c68450884a", "op_name": "LLMFilter", "time_per_record": 4.2326340675354, "cost_per_record": 0.0040525000000000005, "source_unique_full_op_ids": null, "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "94e693191e", "quality": 1.0, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": {"passed_operator": false}, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 1353.0, "total_output_tokens": 67.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0033825, "total_output_cost": 0.00067, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": "The content mentions tee times", "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": false, "llm_call_duration_secs": 4.2311789989471436, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 1, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "prompt_strategy": "filter", "reasoning_effort": "None", "filter": "The content mentions tee times", "desc": "None"}}, {"record_id": "22c7d0bd0a", "record_parent_ids": ["ad320b5a9f"], "record_source_indices": ["emails-10"], "record_state": {"filename": "arnold-j-inbox-166.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <14163285.1075861676333.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 27 Nov 2001 10:25:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: kbusch@energyargus.com\nTo: john.arnold@enron.com\nSubject: keeping the lights on\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: \"Kelly Busch\" <kbusch@energyargus.com>@ENRON\nX-To: Arnold, John </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JARNOLD>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\JARNOLD (Non-Privileged)\\Arnold, John\\Inbox\nX-Origin: Arnold-J\nX-FileName: JARNOLD (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n\nJohn-\nWas lovely meeting  you this weekend.

We really do but have been holed up trying to complete\nthis project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we\nfound that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our\nusers back on-line.\n\nWe have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked\nyour additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This\nprocess was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100\nIBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and\nconfidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying\ndata and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of\nyou (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than\nonce or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want\ndisplayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or\nphone) the information to us and we will remove this information right\naway.\n\nTo our IBS Billpayer clients:\n\nDuring this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill\npayment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring\npayments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our\nhighest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the\nprocess of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this\ninformation. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the\nmonths of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence\n(and support).\n\nAgain, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and\nourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be\none of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account\ninformation, please refer to the following information:\n\n1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was\nthe correct password) and been given the error message \"You have failed\nto correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or\ncontact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset.\" This is\nthe easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you\nonline (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you\nreceive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for\neither myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @\n830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail\n(or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back\n#.\n\n2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the\nssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the\nlast six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the\nprimary account holder. Since we have released these accounts for IBS\naccess, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn#\n(this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will\nbe directed to a screen that asks for information such as:\n\nName\nAddress\nCity, State Zip+4\nPhone #\nE-Mail Address\n\nAfter entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be\ninstructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can\nat this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always\nremember that your password is case sensitive.\n\nAgain we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying)\nordeal, and we look forward to serving your IBS needs in the future.\n\nSincerely,\n\nHoward Gordon\nNetwork Manager\n\n - geninfo.vcf "}, "full_op_id": "c68450884a-80d457d66d", "logical_op_id": "c68450884a", "op_name": "LLMFilter", "time_per_record": 2.2802798748016357, "cost_per_record": 0.0045475, "source_unique_full_op_ids": null, "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "94e693191e", "quality": 1.0, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": {"passed_operator": false}, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 1455.0, "total_output_tokens": 91.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0036375, "total_output_cost": 0.0009100000000000001, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": "The content mentions tee times", "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": false, "llm_call_duration_secs": 2.2780447006225586, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 1, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "prompt_strategy": "filter", "reasoning_effort": "None", "filter": "The content mentions tee times", "desc": "None"}}, {"record_id": "10ea547bdf", "record_parent_ids": ["404b22cfff"], "record_source_indices": ["emails-18"], "record_state": {"filename": "arnold-j-inbox-96.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <4724114.1075855217865.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 31 Dec 2001 13:20:07 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: customerservice@qwikfliks.com\nTo: john.arnold@enron.com\nSubject: L.A.

This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =\nof the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=\ns of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=\nceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=\n of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=\n of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=\nrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=\ns a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=\nock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=\nres in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=\nn several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=\nat the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=\nf Enron Corp. common stock.\n\nThere are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=\n  section 6.3 begins with \"notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=\n\"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=\nctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=\nt apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating \"a single sum distrib=\nution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts\" indicates that one pay=\nment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.\n\nThe interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =\nis the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=\nhe Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states \"The val=\nue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=\ng price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=\nment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock\".=\n  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=\n share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =\nbeneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=\np. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=\nction 6.3.\n\nThe calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=\n distribution under each of the three interpretations:\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1\n\nNumber of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=\nes\nRelative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13\nPhantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658\n10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866\nValue to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792\nCurrent stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10\nDistribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares\n\nI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.

This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =\nof the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=\ns of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=\nceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=\n of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=\n of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=\nrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=\ns a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=\nock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=\nres in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=\nn several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=\nat the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=\nf Enron Corp. common stock.\n\nThere are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=\n  section 6.3 begins with \"notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=\n\"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=\nctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=\nt apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating \"a single sum distrib=\nution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts\" indicates that one pay=\nment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.\n\nThe interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =\nis the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=\nhe Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states \"The val=\nue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=\ng price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=\nment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock\".=\n  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=\n share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =\nbeneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=\np. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=\nction 6.3.\n\nThe calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=\n distribution under each of the three interpretations:\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1\n\nNumber of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=\nes\nRelative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13\nPhantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658\n10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866\nValue to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792\nCurrent stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10\nDistribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares\n\nI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =\nadministrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=\n.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =\na hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. =\n =20\n\nIn addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=\n same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt=\ner.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nPhillip Allen   =20\n=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09"}, "full_op_id": "0d9c20c90c-1d7551c05a", "logical_op_id": "0d9c20c90c", "op_name": "MarshalAndScanDataOp", "time_per_record": 0.0017497539520263672, "cost_per_record": 0.0, "source_unique_full_op_ids": [], "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "8be2def509", "quality": null, "model_name": null, "answer": null, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 0.0, "total_output_tokens": 0.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0, "total_output_cost": 0.0, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": null, "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": true, "llm_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 0, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"datasource_id": "emails"}}, {"record_id": "404b22cfff", "record_parent_ids": null, "record_source_indices": ["emails-18"], "record_state": {"filename": "arnold-j-inbox-96.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <4724114.1075855217865.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 31 Dec 2001 13:20:07 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: customerservice@qwikfliks.com\nTo: john.arnold@enron.com\nSubject: L.A.

As it increases, the Spread decreases.\n\t- In a running market, the offset will increase quickly. If it establishes a new level, the Offset will slowly decrease\n\t- If the market runs up and whipsaws back, the offset will stay large\n\t- If a market range trades, the offset will trend to zero.\n\t- If there are a large number of transaction in succession, the spread will widen\n\t- If there are a small number of transactions in succession, the spread will tighten.\n\n \n\nDave\n\n\t"}, "full_op_id": "0d9c20c90c-1d7551c05a", "logical_op_id": "0d9c20c90c", "op_name": "MarshalAndScanDataOp", "time_per_record": 0.0004298686981201172, "cost_per_record": 0.0, "source_unique_full_op_ids": [], "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "8be2def509", "quality": null, "model_name": null, "answer": null, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 0.0, "total_output_tokens": 0.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0, "total_output_cost": 0.0, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": null, "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": true, "llm_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 0, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"datasource_id": "emails"}}, {"record_id": "180ff8efac", "record_parent_ids": null, "record_source_indices": ["emails-14"], "record_state": {"filename": "arnold-j-inbox-50.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <29209841.1075852729234.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sun, 28 Oct 2001 05:36:38 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: john.lavorato@enron.com\nTo: john.arnold@enron.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Lavorato, John </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JLAVORA>\nX-To: Arnold, John </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jarnold>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\JARNOLD (Non-Privileged)\\Arnold, John\\Inbox\nX-Origin: Arnold-J\nX-FileName: JARNOLD (Non-Privileged).pst\n\ncurrent -260\nall 150\n \njack +7\nminn +3\ncinci+3\nsf+2.5\nnew orleans +12\ncar +2.5\ndall +3\noak +1.5\nnew eng +7\nbuff +7\nseattle +2.5\nwash +8\n "}, "full_op_id": "0d9c20c90c-1d7551c05a", "logical_op_id": "0d9c20c90c", "op_name": "MarshalAndScanDataOp", "time_per_record": 0.0003230571746826172, "cost_per_record": 0.0, "source_unique_full_op_ids": [], "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "8be2def509", "quality": null, "model_name": null, "answer": null, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 0.0, "total_output_tokens": 0.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0, "total_output_cost": 0.0, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": null, "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": true, "llm_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 0, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"datasource_id": "emails"}}, {"record_id": "8eb1236c6d", "record_parent_ids": null, "record_source_indices": ["emails-7"], "record_state": {"filename": "allen-p-inbox-9.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <32169781.1075855377639.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sun, 30 Dec 2001 18:33:29 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: unsubscribe-i@networkpromotion.com\nTo: pallen@enron.com\nSubject: Too many to chose from - CD player, 2 way Radios, Pencam....\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\nX-From: itsImazing <unsubscribe-i@networkpromotion.com>@ENRON\nX-To: PALLEN@ENRON.COM\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Jan2002_1\\Allen, Phillip K.\\Inbox\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n[IMAGE]\nGet your FREE* Reward NOW!\n=09=09[IMAGE]=09\n=09PHILLIP, this is for REAL... one of America's largest Internet companies=\n has granted you what may be an incredibly valuable reward.

We really do but have been holed up trying to complete\nthis project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we\nfound that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our\nusers back on-line.\n\nWe have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked\nyour additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This\nprocess was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100\nIBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and\nconfidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying\ndata and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of\nyou (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than\nonce or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want\ndisplayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or\nphone) the information to us and we will remove this information right\naway.\n\nTo our IBS Billpayer clients:\n\nDuring this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill\npayment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring\npayments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our\nhighest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the\nprocess of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this\ninformation. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the\nmonths of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence\n(and support).\n\nAgain, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and\nourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be\none of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account\ninformation, please refer to the following information:\n\n1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was\nthe correct password) and been given the error message \"You have failed\nto correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or\ncontact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset.\" This is\nthe easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you\nonline (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you\nreceive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for\neither myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @\n830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail\n(or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back\n#.\n\n2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the\nssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the\nlast six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the\nprimary account holder. Since we have released these accounts for IBS\naccess, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn#\n(this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will\nbe directed to a screen that asks for information such as:\n\nName\nAddress\nCity, State Zip+4\nPhone #\nE-Mail Address\n\nAfter entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be\ninstructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can\nat this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always\nremember that your password is case sensitive.\n\nAgain we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying)\nordeal, and we look forward to serving your IBS needs in the future.\n\nSincerely,\n\nHoward Gordon\nNetwork Manager\n\n - geninfo.vcf "}, "full_op_id": "0d9c20c90c-1d7551c05a", "logical_op_id": "0d9c20c90c", "op_name": "MarshalAndScanDataOp", "time_per_record": 0.0018200874328613281, "cost_per_record": 0.0, "source_unique_full_op_ids": [], "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "8be2def509", "quality": null, "model_name": null, "answer": null, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 0.0, "total_output_tokens": 0.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0, "total_output_cost": 0.0, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": null, "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": true, "llm_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 0, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"datasource_id": "emails"}}, {"record_id": "178ee88d73", "record_parent_ids": null, "record_source_indices": ["emails-4"], "record_state": {"filename": "allen-p-inbox-83.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <33335249.1075863149624.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sun, 25 Nov 2001 19:21:47 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: pallen70@hotmail.com\nTo: pallen@enron.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: \"phillip allen\" <pallen70@hotmail.com>@ENRON\nX-To: pallen@enron.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\PALLEN (Non-Privileged)\\Allen, Phillip K.\\Inbox\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: PALLEN (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n\n\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n - DESIGNSELECTIONS_DyalRoberts.doc "}, "full_op_id": "0d9c20c90c-1d7551c05a", "logical_op_id": "0d9c20c90c", "op_name": "MarshalAndScanDataOp", "time_per_record": 0.0019519329071044922, "cost_per_record": 0.0, "source_unique_full_op_ids": [], "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "8be2def509", "quality": null, "model_name": null, "answer": null, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 0.0, "total_output_tokens": 0.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0, "total_output_cost": 0.0, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": null, "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": true, "llm_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 0, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"datasource_id": "emails"}}, {"record_id": "6c3717b051", "record_parent_ids": null, "record_source_indices": ["emails-2"], "record_state": {"filename": "allen-p-inbox-69.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <16163432.1075862166007.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 27 Nov 2001 11:22:36 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: gthorse@about-cis.com\nTo: k..allen@enron.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: \"Greg Thorse\" <gthorse@about-cis.com>@ENRON\nX-To: Allen, Phillip K. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=PALLEN>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\PALLEN (Non-Privileged)\\Allen, Phillip K.\\Inbox\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: PALLEN (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nPhillip;\n\nThis attachment is my start on your 1031 search.

As it increases, the Spread decreases.\n\t- In a running market, the offset will increase quickly. If it establishes a new level, the Offset will slowly decrease\n\t- If the market runs up and whipsaws back, the offset will stay large\n\t- If a market range trades, the offset will trend to zero.\n\t- If there are a large number of transaction in succession, the spread will widen\n\t- If there are a small number of transactions in succession, the spread will tighten.\n\n \n\nDave\n\n\t"}, "full_op_id": "c68450884a-80d457d66d", "logical_op_id": "c68450884a", "op_name": "LLMFilter", "time_per_record": 1.3329048156738281, "cost_per_record": 0.0040525000000000005, "source_unique_full_op_ids": ["0-0d9c20c90c-1d7551c05a"], "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "8be2def509", "quality": null, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": {"passed_operator": false}, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 1353.0, "total_output_tokens": 67.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0033825, "total_output_cost": 0.00067, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": "The content mentions tee times", "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": false, "llm_call_duration_secs": 1.331664800643921, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 1, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "prompt_strategy": "filter", "reasoning_effort": "None", "filter": "The content mentions tee times", "desc": "None"}}, {"record_id": "521fd7afad", "record_parent_ids": ["180ff8efac"], "record_source_indices": ["emails-14"], "record_state": {"filename": "arnold-j-inbox-50.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <29209841.1075852729234.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sun, 28 Oct 2001 05:36:38 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: john.lavorato@enron.com\nTo: john.arnold@enron.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Lavorato, John </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JLAVORA>\nX-To: Arnold, John </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jarnold>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\JARNOLD (Non-Privileged)\\Arnold, John\\Inbox\nX-Origin: Arnold-J\nX-FileName: JARNOLD (Non-Privileged).pst\n\ncurrent -260\nall 150\n \njack +7\nminn +3\ncinci+3\nsf+2.5\nnew orleans +12\ncar +2.5\ndall +3\noak +1.5\nnew eng +7\nbuff +7\nseattle +2.5\nwash +8\n "}, "full_op_id": "c68450884a-80d457d66d", "logical_op_id": "c68450884a", "op_name": "LLMFilter", "time_per_record": 1.226388931274414, "cost_per_record": 0.0023025, "source_unique_full_op_ids": ["0-0d9c20c90c-1d7551c05a"], "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "8be2def509", "quality": null, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": {"passed_operator": false}, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 685.0, "total_output_tokens": 59.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0017125, "total_output_cost": 0.00059, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": "The content mentions tee times", "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": false, "llm_call_duration_secs": 1.2246510982513428, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 1, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "prompt_strategy": "filter", "reasoning_effort": "None", "filter": "The content mentions tee times", "desc": "None"}}, {"record_id": "dded3b515a", "record_parent_ids": ["0c928fbab7"], "record_source_indices": ["emails-8"], "record_state": {"filename": "arnold-j-inbox-149.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <22448070.1075861675831.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 20 Nov 2001 06:57:42 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: tanya.rohauer@enron.com\nTo: john.arnold@enron.com\nSubject: AIG positions\nCc: joey.taylor@enron.com\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nBcc: joey.taylor@enron.com\nX-From: Rohauer, Tanya </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=TROHAUE>\nX-To: Arnold, John </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jarnold>\nX-cc: Taylor, Joey </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jtaylor1>\nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\JARNOLD (Non-Privileged)\\Arnold, John\\Inbox\nX-Origin: Arnold-J\nX-FileName: JARNOLD (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nJohn,\n\nAs discussed, the AIG exposure is $57MM, and it is distributed among the price, option, and exotic books.\n\nThe attached spreadsheet details the dollar value and volume by month by book.

This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =\nof the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=\ns of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=\nceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=\n of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=\n of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=\nrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=\ns a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=\nock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=\nres in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=\nn several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=\nat the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=\nf Enron Corp. common stock.\n\nThere are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=\n  section 6.3 begins with \"notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=\n\"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=\nctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=\nt apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating \"a single sum distrib=\nution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts\" indicates that one pay=\nment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.\n\nThe interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =\nis the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=\nhe Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states \"The val=\nue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=\ng price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=\nment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock\".=\n  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=\n share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =\nbeneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=\np. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=\nction 6.3.\n\nThe calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=\n distribution under each of the three interpretations:\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1\n\nNumber of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=\nes\nRelative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13\nPhantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658\n10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866\nValue to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792\nCurrent stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10\nDistribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares\n\nI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.

We really do but have been holed up trying to complete\nthis project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we\nfound that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our\nusers back on-line.\n\nWe have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked\nyour additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This\nprocess was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100\nIBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and\nconfidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying\ndata and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of\nyou (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than\nonce or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want\ndisplayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or\nphone) the information to us and we will remove this information right\naway.\n\nTo our IBS Billpayer clients:\n\nDuring this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill\npayment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring\npayments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our\nhighest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the\nprocess of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this\ninformation. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the\nmonths of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence\n(and support).\n\nAgain, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and\nourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be\none of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account\ninformation, please refer to the following information:\n\n1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was\nthe correct password) and been given the error message \"You have failed\nto correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or\ncontact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset.\" This is\nthe easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you\nonline (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you\nreceive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for\neither myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @\n830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail\n(or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back\n#.\n\n2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the\nssn# or tin# of the primary account holder).

A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.\n\nAdditionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  \n\n      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.\n"}, "full_op_id": "c68450884a-80d457d66d", "logical_op_id": "c68450884a", "op_name": "LLMFilter", "time_per_record": 1.4213290214538574, "cost_per_record": 0.0030250000000000003, "source_unique_full_op_ids": ["0-0d9c20c90c-1d7551c05a"], "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "8be2def509", "quality": null, "model_name": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": {"passed_operator": false}, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 954.0, "total_output_tokens": 64.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0023850000000000004, "total_output_cost": 0.00064, "total_embedding_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": "The content mentions tee times", "join_condition": null, "passed_operator": false, "llm_call_duration_secs": 1.4195613861083984, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "total_llm_calls": 1, "total_embedding_llm_calls": 0, "failed_convert": null, "op_details": {"model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "prompt_strategy": "filter", "reasoning_effort": "None", "filter": "The content mentions tee times", "desc": "None"}}], "source_unique_full_op_ids": ["0-0d9c20c90c-1d7551c05a"], "source_unique_logical_op_ids": null, "plan_id": "8be2def509", "op_details": {"model": "openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "prompt_strategy": "filter", "reasoning_effort": "None", "filter": "The content mentions tee times", "desc": "None"}}, "2-9ed10858f9-900de152da": {"full_op_id": "9ed10858f9-900de152da", "op_name": "MixtureOfAgentsConvert", "total_op_time": 9.337026119232178, "total_op_cost": 0.00861, "total_input_tokens": 2164.0, "total_output_tokens": 320.0, "record_op_stats_lst": [{"record_id": "2fe6387da4", "record_parent_ids": ["2105e999c6"], "record_source_indices": ["emails-0"], "record_state": {"filename": "allen-p-inbox-42.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <8268911.1075858645425.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 29 Oct 2001 18:08:10 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: mondohed@gte.net\nTo: pallen@ect.enron.com\nSubject: Fw: Golfin' and Wedding!!!\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: \"Armando Martinez\" <mondohed@gte.net>@ENRON\nX-To: Phillip K Allen <pallen@ect.enron.com>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\PALLEN (Non-Privileged)\\Allen, Phillip K.\\Inbox\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: PALLEN (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n\n \n----- Original Message -----  \nFrom: Stephen  Bilby  \nTo: Alfred E Newman (E-mail)  ; Army (E-mail)  ; Armando Martinez (E-mail)  ;  Bryan Lilley  (E-mail)  ; Craig Carter (E-mail)  ; E.
